                <p class="Text---Headings_About"><h1><em>Writing in College: </em></h1><em>Writing in College: </em> is designed for students who have largely
                    mastered high-school level conventions of formal academic writing and are now moving beyond the
                    five-paragraph essay to more advanced engagement with text. It is well suited to composition courses
                    or
                    first-year seminars and valuable as a supplemental or recommended text in other writing-intensive
                    classes. It provides a friendly, down-to-earth introduction to professors’ goals and expectations,
                    demystifying the norms of the academy and how they shape college writing assignments. Each of the
                    nine
                    chapters can be read separately, and each includes suggested exercises to bring the main messages to
                    life.</p> Students will find in <em>Writing in College</em> a warm invitation to join the academic
                community as novice scholars and to approach writing as a meaningful medium of communication. With
                concise
                discussions, clear multidisciplinary examples, and empathy for the challenges of student life, Guptill
                conveys a welcoming tone. In addition, each chapter includes Student Voices: peer-to-peer wisdom from
                real
                SUNY Brockport students about their strategies for and experiences with college writing. While there are
                many affordable writing guides available, most focus only on sentence-level issues or, conversely, a
                broad
                introduction to making the transition. <em>Writing In College</em>, in contrast, provides both a
                coherent
                frame for approaching writing assignments and indispensable advice for effective organization and
                expression. <h1 class="Text---Headings_About"><a id="_idTextAnchor001"></a>About the Author</h1>

            <p class="Text---Headings_About"><em>Writing in College: From Competence to Excellence</em> assists
                well-prepared high school students as they transition to college writing, helping them understand how
                they,
                as young independent scholars, fit into the university and can improve their writing to succeed in their
                new
                environment. Focusing on the argument-driven essay, Guptill guides beginning college students through
                the
                sometimes arcane practices of the academy and does so with warmth, enthusiasm, and humor. The textbook
                takes
                students through deciphering assignments, developing sophisticated arguments, finding and using
                appropriate
                sources, and some basics of paragraphing, sentence structure, and style. Instructors will find this
                textbook
                to be a handy tool for explaining the argument-driven essay and reference for addressing common
                college-level writing issues. With a diverse range of examples, useful references to other sources, and
                purposeful exercises, <em>Writing in College</em> focuses on developing students’ skills in practical
                ways—and helps students understand why their instructors have them do what they do.</p> <em>Jennifer

                <h1>Yes. Writing. Again.</h1> Obviously you can write. And in the age of Facebook and smartphones, you
                might
                be writing all the time, perhaps more often than speaking. Many students today are awash in text like no
                other generation before. You may have even performed so well in high school that you’re deemed fully
                competent in college level writing and are now excused from taking a composition course. So why spend
                yet
                more time and attention on writing skills? <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.jsportscimed.org/vol2/n1/1/v2n1-1pdf.pdf">Research shows that deliberate
                    practice</a>—that is, close focus on improving one’s skills—makes all the difference in how one
                performs. Revisiting the craft of writing—especially on the early end of college—will improve your
                writing
                much more than simply producing page after page in the same old way. Becoming an excellent communicator
                will
                save you a lot of time and hassle in your studies, advance your career, and promote better relationships
                and
                a higher quality of life off the job. Honing your writing is a good use of your scarce time. Also
                consider
                this: a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aacu.org/leap/documents/2009_EmployerSurvey.pdf">recent
                    survey</a> of employers conducted by the Association of American Colleges and Universities found
                that 89
                percent of employers say that colleges and universities should place more emphasis on “the ability to
                effectively communicate orally and in writing.”<sup><a id="footnote-009-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-009">1</a></sup> It was the single-most favored skill in this survey. In
                addition,
                several of the other valued skills are grounded in written communication: “Critical thinking and
                analytical
                reasoning skills” (81%); “The ability to analyze and solve complex problems” (75%); and “The ability to
                locate, organize, and evaluate information from multiple sources” (68%). This emphasis on communication
                probably reflects the changing reality of work in the professions. Employers also reported that
                employees
                will have to “take on more responsibilities,” “use a broader set of skills,” “work harder to coordinate
                with
                other departments,” face “more complex” challenges, and mobilize “higher levels of learning and
                knowledge.”<sup><a id="footnote-008-backlink" href="#footnote-008">2</a></sup> If you want to be a
                professional who interacts frequently with others<sup><a id="footnote-007-backlink"

                        <p class="Student-Voices">Writing is one of the most important skills to our society, and it
                            almost
                            always has been. Having the ability to write is what separates history from pre-history!
                            That’s
                            a pretty big deal! Because most professors have different expectations, it can be tricky
                            knowing
                            what exactly they’re looking for. Pay attention to the comments they leave on your paper,
                            and
                            make sure to use these as a reference for your next assignment. I try to pay attention and
                            adapt
                            to the professor’s style and preferences.</p>

                    </div>
                </div> The pay-off from improving your writing comes much sooner than graduation. Suppose you complete
                about
                40 classes for a 120-credit bachelors’ degree, and—averaging across writing-intensive and
                non-writing-intensive courses—you produce about 2500 words of formal writing per class. Even with that
                low
                estimate, you’ll write 100,000 words over your college career. That’s about equivalent to a 330-page
                book.
                Spending a few hours sharpening your writing skills will make those 100,000 words much easier and more
                rewarding to write. All of your professors care about good writing, whether or not they see their
                courses as
                a means to improve it. Formal written work is the coin of the academic realm. Creating and sharing
                knowledge—the whole point of the academy—depends on writing. You may have gotten a lot of positive
                feedback
                on your writing before college, but it’s important to note that writing in college is distinct in ways
                that
                reflect the origins of higher education. <h1>The origins of higher education</h1> College may look and
                feel
                similar to high school, and, for the most part, you already know how to perform your student role within
                this setting. However, there are some <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://smu.edu/alec/transition.asp">fundamental differences</a>. The most obvious ones are
                that
                high school is mandatory (to a certain point), freely available, and a legal right. They have to offer
                you
                the opportunity, regardless of your grades. College is optional, costly, and performance-based. Most
                institutions will dismiss you if your grades don’t meet a certain minimum. But college is different in
                more
                subtle ways as well, and those differences reflect the evolution of the university. In their original
                ancient and medieval forms, universities were centers for scholarship, existing at the pleasure of the
                crown, church, or state. While centers of study go at least back to ancient Mesopotamia 2500 years BCE,
                the
                Islamic and European universities of the first and second millennium CE are usually considered the first
                of
                the modern model. Highly privileged people went to these universities as students, but they didn’t
                really
                attend classes, write papers, and take exams like college students today. Instead they acted as
                independent,
                though novice, scholars: they read everything they could find in their areas of interest, attended
                lectures
                that expert scholars gave, and, if they were lucky (and perhaps charming), got some feedback from those
                scholars on their own work or assisted scholars in theirs.<sup><a id="footnote-005-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-005">5</a></sup> Students were simply the most junior of scholars at a
                university,
                enjoying the extraordinary privilege of interacting with the revered academic superstars of their day.
                Obviously, colleges and universities today are much more student-centered,<sup><a
                        id="footnote-004-backlink" href="#footnote-004">6</a></sup> and <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_265.asp">most higher education faculty
                    spend
                    most of their time</a> carefully crafting educational experiences for students. But the notion of
                the
                university as a center for scholarship and exchange still shapes how colleges and universities operate
                today. Some points: <ol>
                    <li><em>Professors are scholars and artists</em>: Most of your professors have had little to no
                        formal
                        training in pedagogy (the science of teaching). They’re extensively trained in their scholarly
                        or
                        creative fields, well versed in relevant theories, methods, and significant findings. Many
                        taught
                        during graduate school, but most come to their jobs relative novices about teaching. Professors
                        apply themselves to the craft of teaching with the same creative and intellectual fervor that
                        drew
                        them into their fields. They attend conferences and presentations about effective teaching and
                        learning (such as <a target="_blank" href="http://lillyconferences.com/">The Lilly
                            Conference</a>,
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aacu.org/meetings/index.cfm">the AAC&amp;U</a>, or <a
                            target="_blank" href="http://www.aera.net/">the American Educational Research
                            Association</a>),
                        keep journals and portfolios to reflect on their teaching work, and read books and articles
                        about
                        cognitive neuroscience, trends in higher education, and the social worlds of their students.
                        There
                        are some professors who still see themselves in the classical model—as someone who delivers
                        content
                        through lectures and assesses performance through a final exam or term paper, but that approach
                        is
                        becoming ever rarer. Almost all professors seek out innovative and engaging pedagogies.</li>
                    <li><em>Professors have competing obligations</em>: While you may view your professors primarily as
                        teachers,<sup><a id="footnote-003-backlink" href="#footnote-003">7</a></sup> your instructors
                        are
                        also collecting data, writing books and articles, making films, writing poetry, consulting with
                        businesses and organizations, or inventing things. Even those who spend a majority of their time
                        on
                        teaching think of themselves as scholars or artists who <em>also</em> teach.<sup><a
                                id="footnote-002-backlink" href="#footnote-002">8</a></sup> Scholarship and creative
                        activity are central ways that colleges and universities serve society. In addition to educated
                        graduates, higher education also produces <a target="_blank"
                            href="http://www.suny.edu/powerofsuny/">ideas, findings, and innovations</a>. High school
                        teachers, though similarly engaged in the craft of teaching, have much more formal training in
                        instruction and are more likely to see themselves primarily as teachers, even those that are
                        writing
                        magazine articles, restoring wetland ecologies, or composing music on the side.</li>
                    <li><em>Professors design their own classes</em>: While both college professors and high school
                        teachers
                        teach, one condition of their work is substantially different. Most high school teachers in
                        public
                        school systems are contractually obligated to deliver a particular curriculum and, in some
                        cases, to
                        use particular methods to do so. The topics and materials are often determined by state
                        regulators,
                        local boards of education, and school administrators. There is room for innovation, but under
                        the
                        current mania for standards, many teachers are no longer treated (and respected) like
                        craftspersons
                        in their own right. Higher education instructors still have a lot more latitude than their
                        high-school counterparts. Your instructor may be required to cover particular concepts and
                        skills or
                        even assign a particular textbook, especially if one class is a prerequisite to more advanced
                        classes. However, he or she still has a lot of freedom to determine what students should learn,
                        what
                        they will do to learn it, and how their achievements will be measured. As a result, two
                        different
                        sections of the same college course (such as Ancient World History) could differ dramatically,
                        much
                        more so than two parallel high school sections.</li>
                    <li><em>Students drive their own learning</em>: The assumption behind high-school instruction is
                        that
                        the teacher is the engine of learning. Consequently, a lot of time is spent in direct
                        face-to-face
                        instruction. Homework is for further practice to reinforce material from that day. Teachers will
                        often tell students what each night’s homework assignment is, follow up on missing work, and
                        closely
                        track students’ progress. The assumption behind college instruction, in contrast, is that
                        students
                        are the engine of learning, and that most of the significant learning happens outside of class
                        while
                        students are working through a dense reading or other challenging intellectual task on their
                        own.
                        Most college classes meet only 1-3 times a week for a total of about 3 hours. Consequently,
                        college
                        instructors think of class meetings as an opportunity to prepare you for the heavy-lifting that
                        you’ll be doing on your own. Sometimes that involves direct instruction (how to solve a
                        particular
                        kind of problem or analyze a particular kind of text). More often, though, professors want to
                        provide you with material not contained in the reading or facilitate active learning experiences
                        based on what you read. The assumption is that all students—like their medieval
                        counterparts—have
                        the skill and self-motivation to carefully read all the assigned texts. Professors lay out a
                        path
                        for learning—much like how personal trainers develop exercise routines—but it is up to students
                        (and
                        athletes) to do the difficult work themselves.</li>
                </ol> While university systems have clearly shifted toward <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://teaching.colostate.edu/tips/tip.cfm?tipid=60">student-centered practices</a>, colleges
                and
                universities still see themselves as communities of scholars, some senior (i.e., faculty), most junior
                (i.e., students). Your professors are passionate about their fields, and they want to share their
                excitement
                with you as effectively as they can. However, they also know that <em>you</em> came to <em>them</em> on
                a
                voluntary basis, and they fully expect you to take complete responsibility for your own learning. <h1>
                    College writing is different</h1> The origins of the university help explain why even skilled
                wordsmiths
                benefit from studying the assumptions and expectations behind college-level writing. College is a
                fundamentally different educational model; as a result <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/instructionalstrategies/writing/poorlyprepared.html">the
                    purposes and expectations for writing are different</a>. You have learned many of the essential
                skills
                and practices of formal written communication throughout your schooling; now it’s time to take your
                writing
                a step further. By the end of high school you probably mastered many of the key conventions of standard
                academic English such as paragraphing, sentence-level mechanics, and the use of thesis statements. The
                <a target="_blank" href="http://sat.collegeboard.org/practice/writing/sat-essay">essay portion of the
                    SAT</a> measures important skills such as organizing evidence within paragraphs that relate to a
                clear,
                consistent thesis, and choosing words and sentence structures to effectively convey your meaning. These
                practices are foundational, and your teachers have given you a wonderful gift in helping you master
                them.
                However, college writing assignments require you to apply those skills to new intellectual challenges.
                Professors assign papers because they want you to think rigorously and deeply about important questions
                in
                their fields. To your instructors, writing is for working out complex ideas, not just explaining them. A
                paper that would earn a top score on the SAT might only get a C or D in a college class if it doesn’t
                show
                original and ambitious thinking. Professors look at you as independent junior scholars and imagine you
                writing as someone who has a genuine, driving interest in tackling a complex question. They envision you
                approaching an assignment without a pre-existing thesis. They expect you to look deep into the evidence,
                consider several alternative explanations, and work out an original, insightful argument that you
                actually
                care about. <a target="_blank" href="http://writing-program.uchicago.edu/resources/collegewriting/">This
                    kind of scholarly approach</a> usually entails writing a rough draft, through which you work out an
                ambitious thesis and the scope of your argument, <sup><a id="footnote-001-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-001">9</a></sup> and then starting over with a wholly rewritten second draft
                containing a mostly complete argument anchored by a refined thesis. In that second round, you’ll
                discover
                holes in the argument that should be remedied, counter-arguments that should be acknowledged and
                addressed,
                and important implications that should be noted. When the paper is substantially complete, you’ll go
                through
                it again to tighten up the writing and ensure clarity.<sup><a id="footnote-000-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-000">10</a></sup> Writing a paper isn’t about getting the “right answer” and
                adhering to basic conventions; it’s about joining an academic conversation with something original to
                say,
                borne of rigorous thought. My own experience as an instructor indicates that few students approach
                writing
                college papers in the way that professors envision. Many students first figure out what they want to say
                and
                then (and only then) write it down as clearly (and quickly) as they can. One quick round of
                proof-reading
                and they’re done. Many students have a powerful distaste for truly revising (i.e., actually rewriting) a
                paper because it feels like throwing away hard-won text. Consequently, when students are invited or
                required
                to revise an essay, they tend to focus on correcting mechanical errors, making a few superficial changes
                that do not entail any rethinking or major changes. Professors find that tendency incredibly
                frustrating.
                Some instructors craft an assignment sequence to force a true revising process; others leave it up to
                you.
                Virtually all shape their expectations for the final project around the idea that you’re writing to
                learn,
                writing to develop, writing to think—not just writing to express. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                        <p class="Student-Voices">On my first college paper, I was scared. I did not know what to expect
                            or
                            what my professor would want. All I kept thinking about was whether or not I would get a
                            good
                            grade. But do not fear! At the end of the day, I talked to my professor about how I could
                            better
                            my writing. Professors love to be asked questions and interact with students. If you ever
                            need
                            help, do not hesitate to ask for advice on how you could do better.</p>

                    </div>
                </div> Another major impact of this shift to a junior-scholar role is that you not only have to learn to
                write like a scholar, you also have to learn to write like a political scientist, a chemist, an art
                historian, and a statistician—sometimes all in the same semester. While most of the conventions of
                academic
                writing are common across disciplines, <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.chc.edu/undergraduate/services/learning_support/writing_center/Writing_in_Multiple_Disciplines_Subjects/">there
                    is some variation</a>. Your professors—immersed as they are in their own fields—may forget that you
                have
                such varied demands, and they may not take class time to explain the particular conventions of their
                field.
                For every new field of study, you’re like a traveler visiting a foreign culture and learning how to get
                along. Locals will often do you the kindness of explaining something, but you’ll have to sleuth out a
                lot of
                things on your own. <h1>So what do professors want?</h1> At one time or another, most students will find
                themselves frustrated by a professor’s recalcitrant refusal to simply “Tell us what you want!” It’s a
                natural feeling and, at times, a legitimate one. While all professors want to set you up to succeed,
                they
                may find their expectations hard to articulate, in part because they struggle to remember what it’s like
                to
                be a beginner in the field. Often, however, the bigger and better reason that professors won’t just tell
                you
                what to do is that there simply isn’t a particular “answer” they want you to give in the paper. They
                want to
                see your own ambitious and careful analysis. Some students assume that they should be able to envision a
                paper and its thesis within minutes of receiving the assignment; if not, they complain that the
                assignment
                is unclear. Other students assume that every professor has a completely different set of expectations
                and,
                consequently, conclude that writing papers is just an unavoidable guessing game about entirely
                subjective
                and idiosyncratic standards. Neither of those assumptions are true. Good, well constructed writing
                assignments are supposed to be challenging to write, and professors are, above all, looking for your own
                self-motivated intellectual work. Despite some variations by discipline, college instructors are
                bringing
                similar standards to evaluating student work. Recently, the Association of American Colleges and
                Universities has brought together faculty members from across the country to deliberate on the <a
                    target="_blank" href="http://www.aacu.org/leap/vision.cfm">core knowledge and skills that define
                    liberal
                    arts education</a>. They have also worked out benchmarks of success, as summarized in a <a
                    target="_blank" href="https://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics/written-communication">rubric for
                    written</a>
                communication. Check it out! While few instructors are sitting down with the AAC&amp;U rubric to
                determine
                grades on papers, you can be confident that these are the kinds of things almost all professors are
                looking
                for. The language of the “capstone” column illustrates especially well the scholarly mindset and
                independent
                work habits they expect students to bring to their work: <blockquote>
                    <div>“thorough understanding of context, audience, and purpose,”</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>“mastery of the subject,”</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>“detailed attention” to writing conventions,</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>“skillful use of high-quality, credible, relevant sources,” and</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>“graceful language.”</div>
                </blockquote> Professors want to see that you’ve thought through a problem and taken the time and effort
                to
                explain your thinking in precise language. The following chapters in this book seek to concretize these
                ideas. They begin with the most fundamental issues (the purpose of the assignment and the thesis), move
                through organizational strategies, and end with sentence-level expression. The expectations laid out
                here
                may seem daunting—and perhaps unreasonable, given that very few of you are going to follow your
                professors
                into academic life. But communication isn’t just about expressing yourself; it’s about connecting with
                others. And it’s other people—in families, couples, communities, and workplaces—that shape the most
                important experiences of your life. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                            have the title “assistant professor” or “associate professor.” It’s because in the original
                            European model there could be only one “Professor” for a given topic, and those other titles
                            were developed for younger scholars. Nowadays most universities have several “professors.”
                            Many
                            newer faculty are still called “assistant professors” even though they don’t assist other
                            faculty.</p>

                            presence at European universities, “colleges” emerged as semi-autonomous units within
                            universities to provide housing, meals, and venues for social interaction. The model of the
                            stand-alone “college” emerged in the Americas after European colonization.</p>

                            faculty member might teach only one or two courses a year. At a community college, an
                            instructor
                            might teach five or six classes a semester. Undergraduate four-year colleges are usually

                <h1>Writing for whom? Writing for what?</h1> The first principle of good communication is <a
                    target="_blank" href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/audience/">knowing your audience</a>.
                This is where writing
                papers for class gets kind of weird. As Peter Elbow explains<sup><a id="footnote-023-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-023">1</a></sup>: <blockquote>
                    <div>When you write for a teacher you are usually swimming against the stream of natural
                        communication.
                        The natural direction of communication is to explain what you understand to someone who doesn’t
                        understand it. But in writing an essay for a teacher your task is usually to explain what you
                        are
                        still engaged in trying to understand to someone who understands it better.</div>
                </blockquote> Often when you write for an audience of one, you write a letter or email. But college
                papers
                aren’t written like letters; they’re written like articles for a hypothetical group of readers that you
                don’t actually know much about. There’s a fundamental mismatch between the real-life audience and the
                form
                your writing takes. It’s kind of bizarre, really. It helps to remember the key tenet of the university
                model: you’re a junior scholar joining the academic community. Academic papers, in which scholars report
                the
                results of their research and thinking to one another, are the lifeblood of the scholarly world,
                carrying
                useful ideas and information to all parts of the academic corpus. Unless there is a particular audience
                specified in the assignment, you would do well to imagine yourself writing for a group of peers who have
                some introductory knowledge of the field but are unfamiliar with the specific topic you’re discussing.
                Imagine them being interested in your topic but also busy; try to write something that is well worth
                your
                readers’ time. Keeping an audience like this in mind will help you distinguish common knowledge in the
                field
                from that which must be defined and explained in your paper. Understanding your audience like this also
                resolve the audience mismatch that Elbow describes. As he notes, “You don’t write <em>to</em> teachers,
                you
                write <em>for</em> them.”<sup><a id="footnote-022-backlink" href="#footnote-022">2</a></sup> Another
                basic
                tenet of good communication is clarifying the purpose of the communication and letting that purpose
                shape
                your decisions. Your professor wants to see you work through complex ideas and deepen your knowledge
                through
                the process of producing the paper. Each assignment—be it an argumentative paper, reaction paper,
                reflective
                paper, lab report, discussion question, blog post, essay exam, project proposal, or what have you—is
                ultimately about your learning. To succeed with writing assignments (and benefit from them) you first
                have
                to understand their learning-related purposes. As you write for the hypothetical audience of peer junior
                scholars, you’re demonstrating to your professor how far you’ve gotten in analyzing your topic. <div

                generally the hardest, most intensive work instructors do.<sup><a id="footnote-021-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-021">3</a></sup> With every assignment they give you, professors assign
                themselves
                many, many hours of demanding and tedious work that has to be completed while they are also preparing
                for
                each class meeting, advancing their scholarly and creative work, advising students, and serving on
                committees. Often, they’re grading your papers on evenings and weekends because the conventional work
                day is
                already saturated with other obligations. You would do well to approach every assignment by putting
                yourself
                in the shoes of your instructor and asking yourself, “Why did she give me this assignment? How does it
                fit
                into the learning goals of the course? Why is this question/topic/problem so important to my professor
                that
                he is willing to spend evenings and weekends reading and commenting on several dozen novice papers on
                it?”
                As I briefly discussed in <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/writing-in-college-from-competence-to-excellence/chapter/really-writing-again/">Chapter
                    1</a>, most instructors do a lot to make their pedagogical goals and expectations transparent to
                students: they explain the course learning goals associated with assignments, provide grading rubrics in
                advance, and describe several strategies for succeeding. Other professors … not so much. Some students
                perceive more open-ended assignments as evidence of a lazy, uncaring, or even incompetent instructor.
                Not so
                fast! Professors certainly vary in the quantity and specificity of the guidelines and suggestions they
                distribute with each writing assignment. Some professors make a point to give very few parameters about
                an
                assignment—perhaps just a topic and a length requirement—and they likely have some good reasons for
                doing
                so. Here are some possible reasons: <ol>
                    <li><em>They figured it out themselves when they were students</em>. Unsurprisingly, your
                        instructors
                        were generally successful students who relished the culture and traditions of higher education
                        so
                        much that they strove to build an academic career. The current emphasis on <a target="_blank"
                            href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/teacher-centered-vs-student-centered-pedagogy/22714">student-centered
                            instruction</a> is relatively recent; your instructors much more often had professors who
                        adhered to the classic model of college instruction: they gave lectures together with, perhaps,
                        one
                        or two exams or papers. Students were on their own to learn the lingo and conventions of each
                        field,
                        to identify the key concepts and ideas within readings and lectures, and to sleuth out
                        instructors’
                        expectations for written work. Learning goals, rubrics, quizzes, and preparatory assignments
                        were
                        generally rare.</li>
                    <li><em>They think figuring it out yourself is good for you</em>. Because your professors by and
                        large

                        gave
                        them life-long problem-solving skills. Many think you <em>should</em> be able to figure it out
                        yourself and that it would be good practice for you to do so. Even those who do include a lot of
                        guidance with writing assignments sometimes worry that they’re depriving you of an important
                        personal and intellectual challenge. Figuring out unspoken expectations is a valuable skill in
                        itself.</li>
                    <li><em>They’re egg-heads</em>. As I explained in <a target="_blank"

                            1</a>, many of your instructors have been so immersed in their fields that they may struggle
                        to
                        remember what it was like to encounter a wholly new discipline for the first time. The
                        assumptions,
                        practices, and culture of their disciplines are like the air they breathe; so much so that it is
                        hard to describe to novices. They may assume that a verb like “analyze” is self-evident,
                        forgetting
                        that it can mean very different things in different fields. As a student, you voluntarily came
                        to
                        study with the scholars, artists, and writers at your institution. Rightly or wrongly, the
                        burden is
                        ultimately on you to meet them where they are.</li>

                        to address a defined curriculum. Professors are often extremely wary of anything that <a
                            target="_blank" href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/10/31/inquiry">seems to
                            threaten
                            academic freedom</a>. Some see specified learning goals and standardized rubrics as the
                        first
                        step in a process that would strip higher education of its independence, scholarly innovation,
                        and
                        sense of discovery. While a standardized set of expectations and practices might make it easier
                        to
                        earn a degree, it’s also good to consider the benefits of the more flexible and diversified
                        model.
                    </li>
                </ol> It is understandably frustrating when you feel you don’t know how to direct your efforts to
                succeed
                with an assignment. However, except for rare egregious situations, you would do well to assume the best
                of
                your instructor and to appreciate the diversity of learning opportunities you have access to in college.
                Like one first-year student told Keith Hjortshoj<sup><a id="footnote-020-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-020">4</a></sup>, “I think that every course, every assignment, is a different
                little puzzle I have to solve. What do I need to do here? When do I need to do it, and how long will it
                take? What does this teacher expect of me?” The transparency that you get from some professors—along
                with
                guides like this one—will be a big help to you in situations where you have to be scrappier and more
                pro-active, piecing together the clues you get from your professors, the readings, and other course
                documents. <h1>The prompt: what does “analyze” mean anyway?</h1> Often, the handout or other written
                text
                explaining the assignment—what professors call the <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/688/01/">assignment prompt</a>—will explain the
                purpose
                of the assignment, the required parameters (length, number and type of sources, referencing style,
                etc.),
                and the criteria for evaluation. Sometimes, though—especially when you are new to a field—you will
                encounter
                the baffling situation in which you comprehend every single sentence in the prompt but still have
                absolutely
                no idea how to approach the assignment. No one is doing anything wrong in a situation like that. It just
                means that further discussion of the assignment is in order. Here are some tips: <ol>
                    <li><em>Focus on the</em> <a target="_blank"
                            href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/understanding-assignments/"><span
                                class="Book-Title-Hyperlink">verbs</span></a>. Look for verbs like “compare,” “explain,”
                        “justify,” “reflect” or the all-purpose “analyze.” You’re not just producing a paper as an
                        artifact;
                        you’re conveying, in written communication, some intellectual work you have done. So the
                        question
                        is, what kind of thinking are you supposed to do to deepen your learning?</li>
                    <li><em>Put the assignment in context</em>. Many professors think in terms of <a target="_blank"
                            href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~writing/materials/faculty/methods/design.shtml">assignment
                            sequences</a>. For example, a social science professor may ask you to write about a
                        controversial issue three times: first, arguing for one side of the debate; second, arguing for
                        another; and finally, from a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective, incorporating text
                        produced
                        in the first two assignments. A sequence like that is designed to help you think through a
                        complex
                        issue. Another common one is a scaffolded research paper sequence: you first propose a topic,
                        then
                        prepare an annotated bibliography, then a first draft, then a final draft, and, perhaps, a
                        reflective paper. The preparatory assignments help ensure that you’re on the right track,
                        beginning
                        the research process long before the final due date, and taking the time to consider recasting
                        your
                        thesis, finding additional sources, or reorganizing your discussion.<sup><a
                                id="footnote-019-backlink" href="#footnote-019">5</a></sup>If the assignment isn’t part
                        of a
                        sequence, think about where it falls in the semester, and how it relates to readings and other
                        assignments. Are there headings on the <a target="_blank"
                            href="http://blog.chegg.com/2012/01/08/top-10-secrets-of-leveraging-the-course-syllabus/">syllabus</a>
                        that indicate larger units of material? For example, if you see that a paper comes at the end of
                        a
                        three-week unit on the role of the Internet in organizational behavior, then your professor
                        likely
                        wants you to synthesize that material in your own way. You should also check your notes and
                        online
                        course resources for any other guidelines about the workflow. Maybe you got a rubric a couple
                        weeks
                        ago and forgot about it. Maybe your instructor posted a link about “how to make an annotated
                        bibliography” but then forgot to mention it in class.</li>
                    <li><em>Try a free-write</em>. When I hand out an assignment, I often ask students to do a
                        five-minute
                        or ten-minute free-write. A free-write is when you just write, without stopping, for a set
                        period of
                        time. That doesn’t sound very “free;” it actually sounds kind of coerced. The “free” part is
                        <em>what</em> you write—it can be whatever comes to mind. <a target="_blank"
                            href="http://www.writersdigest.com/tip-of-the-day/freewriting-discover-your-inner-voice-find-inspiration-to-write">Professional
                            writers use free-writing</a> to get started on a challenging (or distasteful) writing task
                        or to
                        overcome writers block or a powerful urge to procrastinate. The idea is that if you just make
                        yourself write, you can’t help but produce some kind of useful nugget. Thus, even if the first
                        eight
                        sentences of your free write are all variations on “I don’t understand this” or “I’d really
                        rather
                        be doing something else,” eventually you’ll write something like “I guess the main point of this
                        is
                        …” and—booyah!—you’re off and running. As an instructor, I’ve found that asking students to do a
                        brief free-write right after I hand out an assignment generates useful clarification questions.
                        If
                        your instructor doesn’t make time for that in class, a quick free-write on your own will quickly
                        reveal whether you need clarification about the assignment and, often, what questions to ask.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Ask for clarification the right way</em>. Even the most skillfully crafted assignments may
                        need
                        some verbal clarification, especially because students’ familiarity with the field can vary
                        enormously. Asking for clarification is a good thing. Be aware, though, that instructors get
                        frustrated when they perceive that students want to skip doing their own thinking and instead
                        receive an exact recipe for an A paper. Go ahead and ask for clarification, but try to convey
                        that
                        you want to learn and you’re ready to work.In general, avoid starting a question with “Do we
                        have to
                        …” because I can guarantee that your instructor is thinking, “You don’t <em>have</em> to do
                        crap.
                        You’re an adult. You chose college. You chose this class. You’re free to exercise your right to
                        fail.” Similarly, avoid asking the professor about what he or she “wants.” You’re not performing
                        some service for the professor when you write a paper. What they “want” is for you to really
                        think
                        about the material.</li>

                <h1>Rubrics as road maps</h1> If a professor provides a grading rubric with an assignment prompt, thank
                your
                lucky stars (and your professor). If the professor took the trouble to prepare and distribute it, you
                can be
                sure that he or she will use it to grade your paper. He or she may not go over it in class, but it’s the
                clearest possible statement of what the professor is looking for in the paper. If it’s wordy, it may
                seem
                like those online “terms and conditions” that we routinely accept without reading. But you really should
                read it over carefully before you begin and again as your work progresses. A lot of rubrics do have some
                useful specifics. Mine, for example, often contain phrases like “makes at least six error-free
                connections
                to concepts or ideas from the course,” or “gives thorough consideration to at least one plausible
                counter-argument.” Even less specific criteria (such as “incorporates course concepts” and “considers
                counter-arguments”) will tell you how you should be spending your writing time. Even the best rubrics
                aren’t
                completely transparent. They simply can’t be. Take, for example, the <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics/written-communication">AAC&amp;U rubric discussed in
                    Chapter
                    1</a>. It has been drafted and repeatedly revised by a multidisciplinary expert panel and tested
                multiple times on sample student work to ensure reliability. But it is still seems kind of vague. What
                is
                the real difference between “demonstrating a thorough understanding of context, audience, and purpose”
                and
                “demonstrating adequate consideration” of the same? It depends on the specific context. So how can you
                know
                whether you’ve done that? A big part of what you’re learning, through feedback from your professors, is
                to
                judge the quality of your writing for yourself. Your future bosses are counting on that. At this point,
                it
                is better to think of rubrics as roadmaps, displaying your destination, rather than a GPS system
                directing
                every move you make. Behind any rubric is the essential goal of higher education: helping you take
                charge of
                your own learning, which means writing like an independently motivated scholar. Are you tasked with
                proposing a research paper topic? Don’t just tell the professor what you want to do, convince him or her
                of
                the salience of your topic, as if you were a scholar seeking grant money. Is it a reflection paper? Then
                outline both the insights you’ve gained and the intriguing questions that remain, as a scholar would.
                Are
                you writing a thesis-driven analytical paper? Then apply the concepts you’ve learned to a new problem or
                situation. Write as if your scholarly peers around the country are eagerly awaiting your unique
                insights.
                Descriptors like “thoroughness” or “mastery” or “detailed attention” convey the vision of student
                writers
                making the time and rigorous mental effort to offer something new to the ongoing, multi-stranded
                academic
                conversation. What your professor wants, in short, is critical thinking. <h1>What’s critical about
                    critical
                    thinking?</h1> Critical thinking is one of those terms that has been used so often and in so many
                different ways that if often seems meaningless. It also makes one wonder, is there such a thing as
                uncritical thinking? If you aren’t thinking critically, then are you even thinking? Despite the
                prevalent
                ambiguities, critical thinking actually does mean something. <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics/pdf/CriticalThinking.pdf">The Association of American
                    Colleges
                    and Universities</a> usefully defines it as “a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive
                exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or
                conclusion.”<sup><a id="footnote-018-backlink" href="#footnote-018">6</a></sup> That definition aligns
                with
                the best description of critical thinking I ever heard; it came from my junior high art teacher, Joe
                Bolger.<sup><a id="footnote-017-backlink" href="#footnote-017">7</a></sup> He once asked us, “What color
                is
                the ceiling?” In that withering tween tone, we reluctantly replied, “Whiiiite.” He then asked, “What
                color
                is it really?” We deigned to aim our pre-adolescent eyes upwards, and eventually began to offer more
                accurate answers: “Ivory?” “Yellow-ish tan.” “It’s grey in that corner.” After finally getting a few
                thoughtful responses, Mr. Bolger said something like, “Making good art is about drawing what you see,
                not
                what you think you’re supposed to see.” The AAC&amp;U definition, above, essentially amounts to the same
                thing: taking a good look and deciding what you <em>really</em> think rather than relying on the first
                idea
                or assumption that comes to mind. <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics/CriticalThinking.cfm">The critical thinking rubric</a>
                produced
                by the AAC&amp;U describes the relevant activities of critical thinking in more detail. To think
                critically,
                one must … <blockquote>
                    <div>(a) “clearly state and comprehensively describe the issue or problem”,</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>(b) “independently interpret and evaluate sources”,</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>(c) “thoroughly analyze assumptions behind and context of your own or others’ ideas”,</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>(d) “argue a complex position and one that takes counter-arguments into account,” and</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>(e) “arrive at logical and well informed conclusions”.<sup><a id="footnote-016-backlink"
                                href="#footnote-016">8</a></sup></div>
                </blockquote> While you are probably used to providing some evidence for your claims, you can see that
                college-level expectations go quite a bit further. When professors assign an analytical paper, they
                don’t
                just want you to formulate a plausible-sounding argument. They want you to dig into the evidence, think
                hard
                about unspoken assumptions and the influence of context, and then explain what you really think and why.
                Interestingly, the AAC&amp;U defines critical thinking as a “habit of mind” rather than a discrete
                achievement. And there are at least two reasons to see critical thinking as a craft or art to pursue
                rather
                than a task to check off. First, the <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-in-everyday-life-9-strategies/512">more
                    you think critically, the better you get at it</a>. As you get more and more practice in closely
                examining claims, their underlying logic, and alternative perspectives on the issue, it’ll begin to feel
                automatic. You’ll no longer make or accept claims that begin with “Everyone knows that …” or end with
                “That’s just human nature.” Second, just as artists and craftspersons hone their skills over a lifetime,
                learners continually expand their critical thinking capacities, both through the feedback they get from
                others and <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/becoming-a-critic-of-your-thinking/605">their own
                    reflections</a>. Artists of all kinds find satisfaction in continually seeking greater challenges.
                Continual reflection and improvement is part of the craft. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                        <p class="Student-Voices">As soon as I see the phrase “critical thinking,” the first thing I
                            think
                            is <span class="bolditalics">more work</span>. It always sounds as if you’re going to have
                            to
                            think harder and longer. But I think the AAC&amp;U’s definition is on point, critical
                            thinking
                            is a habit. Seeing that phrase shouldn’t be a scary thing because by this point in many
                            people’s
                            college career this is an automatic response. I never expect an answer to a question to be
                            in
                            the text; by now I realize that my professors want to know what I have to say about
                            something or
                            what I have learned. In a paper or essay, the three-step thesis process explained in <a

                                3</a> is a tool that will help you get this information across. While you’re doing the
                            hard
                            work (the thinking part), this formula offers you a way to clearly state your position on a
                            subject. It’s as simple as: make a general statement, make an arguable statement, and
                            finally,
                            say why it is important. This is my rule of thumb, and I would not want to start a
                            thesis-driven
                            paper any other way!</p>

                    </div>
                </div> Critical thinking is hard work. Even those who actively choose to do it experience it as tedious,
                difficult, and sometimes surprisingly emotional. Nobel-prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman
                explains
                that our brains aren’t designed to think; rather, they’re designed to save us from having to
                think.<sup><a id="footnote-015-backlink" href="#footnote-015">9</a></sup> Our brains are great at
                developing
                routines and repertoires that enable us to accomplish fairly complex tasks like driving cars, choosing
                groceries, and having a conversation without thinking consciously and thoroughly about every move we
                make.
                Kahneman calls this “fast thinking.” “Slow thinking,” which is deliberate and painstaking, is something
                our
                brains seek to avoid. That built-in tendency can lead us astray. Kahneman and his colleagues often used
                problems like this one in experiments to gauge how people used fast and slow thinking in different
                contexts:<sup><a id="footnote-014-backlink" href="#footnote-014">10</a></sup>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>A bat and ball cost $1.10.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>The bat costs one dollar more than the ball.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>How much does the ball cost?</div>
                </blockquote> Most people automatically say the ball costs $0.10. However, if the bat costs $1 more,
                than
                the bat would cost $1.10 leading to the incorrect total of $1.20. The ball costs $0.05. Kahneman notes,
                “Many thousands of university students have answered the bat-and-ball puzzle, and the results are
                shocking.
                More than 50% of students at Harvard, MIT, and Princeton gave the intuitive—incorrect—answer.” These and
                other results confirm that “many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their
                intuitions.”<sup><a id="footnote-013-backlink" href="#footnote-013">11</a></sup> Thinking
                critically—thoroughly questioning your immediate intuitive responses—is difficult work, but every
                organization and business in the world needs people who can do that effectively. Some students assume
                that
                an unpleasant critical thinking experience means that they’re either doing something wrong or that it’s
                an
                inherently uninteresting (and oppressive) activity. While we all relish those times when we’re
                pleasantly
                absorbed in a complex activity (what <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow">psychologist Mihaly Czikszentmihalyi
                    calls “flow”</a><sup><a id="footnote-012-backlink" href="#footnote-012">12</a></sup>), the more
                tedious
                experiences can also bring satisfaction, sort of like a good work-out. Critical thinking can also be
                emotionally challenging, researchers have found. Facing a new realm of uncertainty and contradiction
                without
                relying on familiar assumptions is inherently anxiety-provoking because when you’re doing it, you are,
                by
                definition, incompetent. Recent research has highlighted that both children and adults need to be able
                to
                regulate their own emotions in order to cope with the challenges of building competence in a new
                area.<sup><a id="footnote-011-backlink" href="#footnote-011">13</a></sup> The kind of critical thinking
                your
                professors are looking for—that is, pursuing a comprehensive, multi-faceted exploration in order to
                arrive
                at an arguable, nuanced argument—is inevitably a struggle and it may be an emotional one. Your best bet

                            thoughts so you’ll have to do quite a few of them. Have no fear though; they do get easier

                Professional
                working roles demand critical thinking, as <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.aacu.org/leap/documents/2009_EmployerSurvey.pdf">81% of major employers reported in

                        href="#footnote-010">14</a></sup>,
                and it’s pretty easy to imagine how critical thinking helps one make much better decisions in all
                aspects of
                life. Embrace it. And just as athletes, artists, and writers sustain their energy and inspiration for
                hard
                work by interacting with others who share these passions, look to others in the scholarly community—your
                professors and fellow students—to keep yourself engaged in these ongoing intellectual challenges. While
                writing time is often solitary, it’s meant to plug you into a vibrant academic community. What your
                professors want, overall, is for you to join them in asking and pursuing important questions about the

                <h1 class="Text---Headings_Chapter-Number">Moving beyond the five-paragraph theme</h1> As an instructor,
                I’ve noted that a number of new (and sometimes not-so-new) students are skilled wordsmiths and generally
                clear thinkers but are nevertheless stuck in a high-school style of writing. They struggle to let go of
                certain assumptions about how an academic paper <em>should be</em>. <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/writing-in-college-from-competence-to-excellence/chapter/really-writing-again/">Chapter
                    1</a> points to the essay portion of the SAT as a representative artifact of the writing skills that
                K-12 education imparts. Some students who have mastered that form, and enjoyed a lot of success from
                doing
                so, assume that college writing is simply more of the same. The skills that go into a very basic kind of
                essay—often called <a target="_blank" href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/college-writing/">the
                    five-paragraph theme</a>—are indispensable. If you’re good at the five-paragraph theme, then you’re
                good
                at identifying a clear and consistent thesis, arranging cohesive paragraphs, organizing evidence for key
                points, and situating an argument within a broader context through the intro and conclusion. In college
                you
                need to build on those essential skills. The five-paragraph theme, as such, is bland and formulaic; it
                doesn’t compel deep thinking. Your professors are looking for a more ambitious and arguable thesis, a
                nuanced and compelling argument, and real-life evidence for all key points, all in an organically<sup><a
                        id="footnote-029-backlink" href="#footnote-029">1</a></sup> structured paper. Figures 3.1 and
                3.2
                contrast the standard five-paragraph theme and the organic college paper. The five-paragraph theme,
                outlined
                in Figure 3.1 is probably what you’re used to: the introductory paragraph starts broad and gradually
                narrows
                to a thesis, which readers expect to find at the very end of that paragraph. In this idealized format,
                the
                thesis invokes the magic number of three: three reasons why a statement is true. Each of those reasons
                is
                explained and justified in the three body paragraphs, and then the final paragraph restates the thesis
                before gradually getting broader. This format is easy for readers to follow, and it helps writers
                organize
                their points and the evidence that goes with them. That’s why you learned this format. Figure 3.2, in
                contrast, represents a paper on the same topic that has the more organic form expected in college. The
                first
                key difference is the thesis. Rather than simply positing a number of reasons to think that something is
                true, it puts forward an arguable statement: one with which a reasonable person might disagree. An
                arguable
                thesis gives the paper purpose. It surprises readers and draws them in. You hope your reader thinks,
                “Huh.
                Why would they come to that conclusion?” and then feels compelled to read on. The body paragraphs, then,
                build on one another to carry out this ambitious argument. In the classic five-paragraph theme (Figure
                3.1)
                it hardly matters which of the three reasons you explain first or second. In the more organic structure
                (Figure 3.2) each paragraph specifically leads to the next. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                    </div>
                </div> The last key difference is seen in the conclusion. Because the organic essay is driven by an
                ambitious, non-obvious argument, the reader comes to the concluding section thinking “OK, I’m convinced
                by
                the argument. What do you, author, make of it? Why does it matter?” The conclusion of an organically
                structured paper has a real job to do. It doesn’t just reiterate the thesis; it explains why the thesis
                matters. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                </div> The substantial time you spent mastering the five-paragraph form in Figure 3.1 was time well
                spent;
                it’s hard to imagine anyone succeeding with the more organic form without the organizational skills and
                habits of mind inherent in the simpler form. But if you assume that you must adhere rigidly to the
                simpler
                form, you’re blunting your intellectual ambition. Your professors will not be impressed by obvious
                theses,
                loosely related body paragraphs, and repetitive conclusions. They want you to undertake an ambitious
                independent analysis, one that will yield a thesis that is somewhat surprising and challenging to
                explain.
                <h1>The three-story thesis: from the ground up</h1> You have no doubt been drilled on the need for a
                thesis
                statement and its proper location at the end of the introduction. And you also know that all of the key
                points of the paper should clearly support the central driving thesis. Indeed, the whole model of the
                five-paragraph theme hinges on a clearly stated and consistent thesis. However, some students are
                surprised—and dismayed—when some of their early college papers are criticized for not having a good
                thesis.
                Their professor might even claim that the paper doesn’t have a thesis when, in the author’s view it
                clearly
                does. So, what makes a good thesis in college? <ol>
                    <li><em>A good thesis is non-obvious</em>. High school teachers needed to make sure that you and all
                        your classmates mastered the basic form of the academic essay. Thus, they were mostly concerned
                        that
                        you had a clear and consistent thesis, even if it was something obvious like “sustainability is
                        important.” A thesis statement like that has a wide-enough scope to incorporate several
                        supporting
                        points and concurring evidence, enabling the writer to demonstrate his or her mastery of the
                        five-paragraph form. Good enough! When they can, high school teachers nudge students to develop
                        arguments that are less obvious and more engaging. College instructors, though, fully expect you
                        to
                        produce something more developed.</li>
                    <li><em>A good thesis is arguable</em>. In everyday life, “arguable” is often used as a synonym for
                        “doubtful.” For a thesis, though, “arguable” means that it’s worth arguing: it’s something with
                        which a reasonable person might disagree. This arguability criterion dovetails with the
                        non-obvious
                        one: it shows that the author has deeply explored a problem and arrived at an argument that
                        legitimately needs 3, 5, 10, or 20 pages to explain and justify. In that way, a good thesis sets
                        an
                        ambitious agenda for a paper. A thesis like “sustainability is important” isn’t at all difficult
                        to
                        argue for, and the reader would have little intrinsic motivation to read the rest of the paper.
                        However, an arguable thesis like “sustainability policies will inevitably fail if they do not
                        incorporate social justice,” brings up some healthy skepticism. Thus, the arguable thesis makes
                        the
                        reader want to keep reading.</li>
                    <li><em>A good thesis is well specified</em>. Some student writers fear that they’re giving away the
                        game if they specify their thesis up front; they think that a purposefully vague thesis might be
                        more intriguing to the reader. However, consider movie trailers: they always include the most
                        exciting and poignant moments from the film to attract an audience. In academic papers, too, a
                        well
                        specified thesis indicates that the author has thought rigorously about an issue and done
                        thorough
                        research, which makes the reader want to keep reading. Don’t just say that a particular policy
                        is
                        effective or fair; say what makes it is so. If you want to argue that a particular claim is
                        dubious
                        or incomplete, say why in your thesis.</li>
                    <li><em>A good thesis includes implications</em>. Suppose your assignment is to write a paper about
                        some
                        aspect of the history of linen production and trade, a topic that may seem exceedingly arcane.
                        And
                        suppose you have constructed a well supported and creative argument that linen was so widely
                        traded
                        in the ancient Mediterranean that it actually served as a kind of currency.<sup><a

                        arguable, well specified thesis. But which of these thesis statements do you find more engaging?

                        through circuits of trade. The economic role of linen raises important questions about how
                        shifting
                        environmental conditions can influence economic relationships and, by extension, political

                more impressive to your professors who, after all, assign topics that they think have enduring
                significance.
                Finding that significance for yourself makes the most of both your paper and your learning. How do you

                    href="http://slc.berkeley.edu/node/252">Many instructors and writers</a> find useful a metaphor
                based on
                this passage by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.:<sup><a id="footnote-027-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-027">3</a></sup>
                <blockquote>

                        skylights.
                        All fact collectors who have no aim beyond their facts are one-story men. Two-story men compare,
                        reason, generalize using the labor of fact collectors as their own. Three-story men idealize,
                        imagine, predict—their best illumination comes from above the skylight.</div>
                </blockquote> One-story theses state inarguable facts. Two-story theses bring in an arguable
                (interpretive
                or analytical) point. Three-story theses nest that point within its larger, compelling implications.
                <sup><a id="footnote-026-backlink" href="#footnote-026">4</a></sup> The biggest benefit of the
                three-story
                metaphor is that it describes a process for building a thesis. To build the first story, you first have
                to
                get familiar with the complex, relevant facts surrounding the problem or question. You have to be able
                to
                describe the situation thoroughly and accurately. Then, with that first story built, you can layer on
                the
                second story by formulating the insightful, arguable point that animates the analysis. That’s often the
                most
                effortful part: brainstorming, elaborating and comparing alternative ideas, finalizing your point. With
                that
                specified, you can frame up the third story by articulating why the point you make matters beyond its
                particular topic or case. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-2">

                    </div>
                </div> For example, imagine you have been assigned a paper about the impact of online learning in higher
                education. You would first construct an account of the origins and multiple forms of online learning and
                assess research findings about its use and effectiveness. If you’ve done that well, you’ll probably come
                up
                with a well considered opinion that wouldn’t be obvious to readers who haven’t looked at the issue in
                depth.
                Maybe you’ll want to argue that online learning is a threat to the academic community. Or perhaps you’ll
                want to make the case that online learning opens up pathways to college degrees that traditional
                campus-based learning does not. In the course of developing your central, argumentative point, you’ll
                come
                to recognize its larger context; in this example, you may claim that online learning can serve to better
                integrate higher education with the rest of society, as online learners bring their educational and
                career
                experiences together. To outline this example: <ul>
                    <li><em>First story</em>: Online learning is becoming more prevalent and takes many different forms.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Second story</em>: While most observers see it as a <em>transformation</em> of higher
                        education,
                        online learning is better thought of an <em>extension</em> of higher education in that it
                        reaches
                        learners who aren’t disposed to participate in traditional campus-based education.</li>
                    <li><em>Third story</em>: Online learning appears to be a promising way to better integrate higher
                        education with other institutions in society, as online learners integrate their educational
                        experiences with the other realms of their life, promoting the freer flow of ideas between the
                        academy and the rest of society.</li>
                </ul> Here’s another example of a three-story thesis:<sup><a id="footnote-025-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-025">5</a></sup>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>First story</em>: Edith Wharton did not consider herself a modernist writer, and she didn’t
                        write like her modernist contemporaries.</li>
                    <li><em>Second story</em>: However, in her work we can see her grappling with both the questions and
                        literary forms that fascinated modernist writers of her era. While not an avowed modernist, she
                        did
                        engage with modernist themes and questions.</li>
                    <li><em>Third story</em>: Thus, it is more revealing to think of modernism as a conversation rather
                        than
                        a category or practice.</li>
                </ul> Here’s one more example: <ul>

                    <li><em>Second story</em>: Research findings to date suggest that the decision to spray pheromones
                        over
                        the skies of several southern Californian counties to combat the LBAM was poorly thought out.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Third story</em>: Together, the scientific ambiguities and the controversial response
                        strengthen
                        the claim that industrial-style approaches to pest management are inherently unsustainable.</li>
                </ul> A thesis statement that stops at the first story isn’t usually considered a thesis. A two-story
                thesis
                is usually considered competent, though some two-story theses are more intriguing and ambitious than
                others.
                A thoughtfully crafted and well informed three-story thesis puts the author on a smooth path toward an

                            in a

                <h1>Three-story theses and the organically structured argument</h1> The three-story thesis is a
                beautiful
                thing. For one, it gives a paper authentic momentum. The first paragraph doesn’t just start with some
                broad,
                vague statement; every sentence is crucial for setting up the thesis. The body paragraphs build on one
                another, moving through each step of the logical chain. Each paragraph leads inevitably to the next,
                making
                the transitions from paragraph to paragraph feel wholly natural. The conclusion, instead of being a
                mirror-image paraphrase of the introduction, builds out the third story by explaining the broader
                implications of the argument. It offers new insight without departing from the flow of the analysis. I
                should note here that a paper with this kind of momentum often reads like it was knocked out in one
                inspired
                sitting. But in reality, just like accomplished athletes and artists, masterful writers make the
                difficult
                thing look easy. As writer Anne Lamott notes, reading a well written piece feels like its author sat
                down
                and typed it out, “bounding along like huskies across the snow.” However, she continues, <blockquote>
                    <div>This is just the fantasy of the uninitiated. I know some very great writers, writers you love
                        who
                        write beautifully and have made a great deal of money, and not one of them sits down routinely
                        feeling wildly enthusiastic and confident. Not one of them writes elegant first drafts. All
                        right,
                        one of them does, but we do not like her very much.<sup><a id="footnote-024-backlink"
                                href="#footnote-024">6</a></sup></div>
                </blockquote> Experienced writers don’t figure out what they want to say and then write it. They write
                in
                order to figure out what they want to say. Experienced writers develop theses in dialog with the body of
                the
                essay. An initial characterization of the problem leads to a tentative thesis, and then drafting the
                body of
                the paper reveals thorny contradictions or critical areas of ambiguity, prompting the writer to revisit
                or
                expand the body of evidence and then refine the thesis based on that fresh look. The revised thesis may
                require that body paragraphs be reordered and reshaped to fit the emerging three-story thesis.
                Throughout
                the process, the thesis serves as an anchor point while the author wades through the morass of facts and
                ideas. The dialogue between thesis and body continues until the author is satisfied or the due date
                arrives,
                whatever comes first. It’s an effortful and sometimes tedious process. Novice writers, in contrast,
                usually
                oversimplify the writing process. They formulate some first-impression thesis, produce a reasonably
                organized outline, and then flesh it out with text, never taking the time to reflect or truly revise
                their
                work. They assume that revision is a step backward when, in reality, it is a major step forward. <div

                            board because it is a lot easier to revise and edit while you write. After I finish writing
                            a
                            paragraph that I am completely satisfied with on the white board, I sit in front of it with

                    </div>
                </div> Another benefit of the three-story thesis framework is that it demystifies what a “strong”
                argument
                is in academic culture. In an era of political polarization, many students may think that a strong
                argument
                is based on a simple, bold, combative statement that is promoted it in the most forceful way possible.
                “Gun
                control is a travesty!” “Shakespeare is the best writer who ever lived!” When students are encouraged to
                consider contrasting perspectives in their papers, they fear that doing so will make their own thesis
                seem
                mushy and weak. However, in academics a “strong” argument is comprehensive and nuanced, not simple and
                polemical. The purpose of the argument is to explain to readers why the author—through the course of his
                or
                her in-depth study—has arrived at a somewhat surprising point. On that basis, it has to consider
                plausible
                counter-arguments and contradictory information. Academic argumentation exemplifies the popular adage
                about
                all writing: show, don’t tell. In crafting and carrying out the three-story thesis, you are showing your
                reader the work you have done. The model of the organically structured paper and the three-story thesis
                framework explained here is the very foundation of the paper itself and the process that produces it.
                The
                subsequent chapters, focusing on sources, paragraphs, and sentence-level wordsmithing, all follow from
                the
                notion that you are writing to think and writing to learn as much as you are writing to communicate.
                Your
                professors assume that you have the self-motivation and organizational skills to pursue your analysis
                with
                both rigor and flexibility; that is, they envision you developing, testing, refining and sometimes
                discarding your own ideas based on a clear-eyed and open-minded assessment of the evidence before you.

                <h1>Ah, the research paper</h1> Such exhilaration! Such consternation! Educators are fond of research
                papers
                because they require you to find your own sources, confront conflicting evidence, and synthesize diverse
                information and ideas—all skills required in any professional leadership role. Research papers also
                allow
                students to pursue their own topic of interest; your professors have to assume that you are genuinely
                interested in at least some major part of the course.<sup><a id="footnote-039-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-039">1</a></sup> The open-endedness of research papers sets you up to do your

                        <p class="Student-Voices">Research papers are, by far, the best kind of papers! If you have an
                            original twist to an old idea and about five good sources, you pretty much have a research
                            paper. Most of the hard work is done for you already! If I can give you one piece of advice
                            for
                            research papers, it would be to know what you’re looking for in an article. If you want
                            statistics, skim for statistics. Knowing what you want will cut down the time it takes you
                            to
                            find sources.</p>

                </div> This chapter is about secondary sources: what they are, where to find them, and how to choose
                them.<sup><a id="footnote-038-backlink" href="#footnote-038">2</a> </sup><a target="_blank"
                    href="http://purchase.libguides.com/content.php?pid=187566&amp;sid=2096450">Recall the distinction
                    between primary and secondary sources</a>. Primary sources are original documents, data, or images:
                the
                law code of the Le Dynasty in Vietnam, the letters of Kurt Vonnegut, data gathered from an experiment on
                color perception, an interview, or Farm Service Administration photographs from the 1930s.<sup><a
                        id="footnote-037-backlink" href="#footnote-037">3</a></sup> Secondary sources are produced by
                analyzing primary sources. They include news articles, scholarly articles, reviews of films or art
                exhibitions, documentary films, and other pieces that have some descriptive or analytical purpose. Some
                things may be primary sources in one context but secondary sources in another. For example, if you’re
                using
                news articles to inform an analysis of a historical event, they’re serving as secondary sources. If
                you’re
                counting the number of times a particular newspaper reported on different types of events, then the news
                articles are serving as primary sources because they’re more akin to raw data. <h1>Some sources are
                    better
                    than others</h1> You probably know by now that if you cite <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> as an authoritative source, the wrath of your professor
                shall
                be visited upon you. Why is it that even the most informative Wikipedia articles are still often
                considered
                illegitimate? And what are good sources to use? The table below summarizes types of secondary sources in
                four tiers. All sources have their legitimate uses, but the top-tier ones are preferable for citation.

                <h4>Tier 1: Peer-reviewed academic publications</h4> These are sources from the mainstream academic
                literature: books and scholarly articles. Academic books generally fall into three categories: (1)
                textbooks
                written with students in mind, (2) monographs which give an extended report on a large research project,
                and
                (3) edited volumes in which each chapter is authored by different people. Scholarly articles appear in
                academic journals, which are published multiple times a year in order to share the latest research
                findings
                with scholars in the field. They’re usually sponsored by some academic society. To get published, these
                articles and books had to earn favorable anonymous evaluations by qualified scholars. Who are the
                experts
                writing, reviewing, and editing these scholarly publications? Your professors. I describe this process
                below. Learning how to read and use these sources is a fundamental part of being a college student. <h4>
                    Tier
                    2: Reports, articles and books from credible non-academic sources</h4> Some events and trends are
                too
                recent to appear in Tier 1 sources. Also, Tier 1 sources tend to be highly specific, and sometimes you
                need
                a more general perspective on a topic. Thus, Tier 2 sources can provide quality information that is more
                accessible to non-academics. There are three main categories. First, official reports from government
                agencies or major international institutions like the <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> or the <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations</a>; these institutions generally have research departments
                staffed with qualified experts who seek to provide rigorous, even-handed information to decision-makers.
                Second, feature articles from major newspapers and magazines like the <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>, <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://online.wsj.com/home-page">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/">London Times</a>, or <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> are based on original reporting by experienced
                journalists (not press releases) and are typically 1500+ words in length. Third, there are some great
                books
                from non-academic presses that cite their sources; they’re often written by journalists. All three of
                these
                sources are generally well researched descriptions of an event or state of the world, undertaken by
                credentialed experts who generally seek to be even-handed. It is still up to you to judge their
                credibility.
                Your instructors and campus librarians can advise you on which sources in this category have the most
                credibility. <h4>Tier 3. Short pieces from periodicals or credible websites</h4> A step below the
                well-developed reports and feature articles that make up Tier 2 are the short tidbits that one finds in
                newspapers and magazines or credible websites. How short is a short news article? Usually, they’re just
                a
                couple paragraphs or less, and they’re often reporting on just one thing: an event, an interesting
                research
                finding, or a policy change. They don’t take extensive research and analysis to write, and many just
                summarize a press release written and distributed by an organization or business. They may describe
                things
                like corporate mergers, newly discovered diet-health links, or important school-funding legislation. You
                may
                want to cite Tier 3 sources in your paper if they provide an important factoid or two that isn’t
                provided by
                a higher-tier piece, but if the Tier 3 article describes a particular study or academic expert, your
                best
                bet is to find the journal article or book it is reporting on and use that Tier 1 source instead. If the
                article mentions which journal the study was published in, you can go right to that journal through your
                library website. Sometimes you can find the original journal article by putting the scholar’s name and
                some
                keywords into Google Scholar. What counts as a credible website in this tier? You may need some guidance
                from instructors or librarians, but you can learn a lot by examining the person or organization
                providing
                the information (look for an “About” link). For example, if the organization is clearly agenda-driven or
                not
                up-front about its aims and/or funding sources, then it definitely isn’t something you want to cite as a
                neutral authority. Also look for signs of expertise. A tidbit about a medical research finding written
                by
                someone with a science background carries more weight than the same topic written by a policy analyst.
                These
                sources are sometimes uncertain, which is all the more reason to follow the trail to a Tier 1 or Tier 2
                source whenever possible. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                        <p class="Student-Voices">Personally, research papers are my thing! They give me a chance to
                            further
                            explore a topic that I usually am genuinely interested in, and it gives me the opportunity
                            to
                            write down everything I know. Sources are easy to find; they’re everywhere. Unfortunately,
                            the
                            useful ones you have to put in a little more effort to find. As much as I love Wikipedia, if
                            I’m
                            going to take the time to write a paper, I want it to be taken seriously. There are so many
                            resources out there to help students find scholarly information. The better the source, the
                            more
                            supported your paper will be. But it doesn’t matter how well supported or amazing your paper
                            is
                            if you don’t cite your sources! A citing mistake could definitely get you a big fat zero on
                            the
                            paper you worked so hard on, and maybe even kicked out of school. Utilize resources like
                            www.easybib.com for a quick works cited, and Purdue’s OWL (english.purdue.edu/owl) for a

                <h4>Tier 4. Agenda-driven or pieces from unknown sources</h4> This tier is essentially everything else,
                including Wikipedia.<sup><a id="footnote-036-backlink" href="#footnote-036">4</a></sup> These types of
                sources—especially Wikipedia—can be hugely helpful in identifying interesting topics, positions within a
                debate, keywords to search on, and, sometimes, higher-tier sources on the topic. They often play a
                critically important role in the early part of the research process, but they generally aren’t (and
                shouldn’t be) cited in the final paper. Throwing some keywords into <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and seeing what you get is a fine way to get started, but
                don’t
                stop there. Start a list of the people, organizations, sources, and keywords that seem most relevant to
                your
                topic. For example, suppose you’ve been assigned a research paper about the impact of linen production
                and
                trade on the ancient world. A quick Google search reveals that (1) linen comes from the flax plant, (2)
                the
                scientific name for flax is <em>Linum usitatissimum,</em> (3) Egypt dominated linen production at the
                height
                of its empire, and (4) Alex J. Warden published a book about ancient linen trade in 1867. Similarly, you
                found some useful search terms to try instead of “ancient world” (antiquity, Egyptian empire, ancient
                Egypt,
                ancient Mediterranean) and some generalizations for linen (fabric, textiles, or weaving). Now you’ve got
                a
                lot to work with as you tap into the library catalog and academic article databases. <h1>Origins and
                    anatomy
                    of a journal article</h1> Most of the Tier 1 sources available are academic articles, also called
                scholarly articles, scholarly papers, journal articles, academic papers, or peer-reviewed articles. They
                all
                mean the same thing: a paper published in an academic periodical after being scrutinized anonymously and
                judged to be sound by other experts in the subfield. Their origin explains both their basic structure
                and
                the high esteem they have in the eyes of your professors. Many journals are sponsored by academic
                associations. Most of your professors belong to some big, general one (such as the <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.mla.org/">Modern Language Association</a><sup><a id="footnote-035-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-035">5</a></sup>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apa.org/">American
                    Psychological Association</a><sup><a id="footnote-034-backlink" href="#footnote-034">6</a></sup>,
                the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shapeamerica.org/">National Association for Sport and Physical
                    Education</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aps.org/">American Physical Society</a>)
                and
                one or more smaller ones organized around particular areas of interest and expertise (such as the <a
                    target="_blank" href="http://www.food-culture.org/">Association for the Study of Food and
                    Society</a>,
                the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iasc-isi.org/">International Association for Statistical
                    Computing</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seefa.org/">Slavic and East European
                    Folklore
                    Association</a>). There are also generalist organizations organized by region of the country or
                state,
                such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.essnet.org/">Eastern Sociological Society</a> or the <a
                    target="_blank" href="http://southernmanagement.org/">Southern Management Association</a>. Each of
                these
                associations exists to promote the exchange of research findings and collaboration in their disciplines.
                Towards this end, they organize conferences, sponsor working groups, and publish one or more academic
                journals. These journals are meant to both publicize and archive the most interesting and important
                findings
                of the field. Academic papers are essentially reports that scholars write to their peers—present and
                future—about what they’ve done in their research, what they’ve found, and why they think it’s important.
                Thus, in a lot of fields they often have a structure reminiscent of the lab reports you’ve written for
                science classes: <ol>
                    <li><em>Abstract</em>: A one-paragraph summary of the article: its purpose, methods, findings, and
                        significance.</li>
                    <li><em>Introduction</em>: An overview of the key question or problem that the paper addresses, why
                        it
                        is important, and the key conclusion(s) (i.e., thesis or theses) of the paper.</li>
                    <li><em>Literature review</em>: A synthesis of all the relevant prior research (the so-called
                        “academic
                        literature” on the subject) that explains why the paper makes an original and important
                        contribution
                        to the body of knowledge.</li>
                    <li><em>Data and methods</em>: An explanation of what data or information the author(s) used and
                        what
                        they did with it.</li>
                    <li><em>Results</em>: A full explanation of the key findings of the study.</li>
                    <li><em>Conclusion/discussion</em>: Puts the key findings or insights from the paper into their
                        broader
                        context; explains why they matter.</li>
                </ol> Not all papers are so “sciencey.” For example, a historical or literary analysis doesn’t
                necessarily
                have a “data and methods” section; but they do explain and justify the research question, describe how
                the
                authors’ own points relate to those made in other relevant articles and books, develop the key insights
                yielded by the analysis, and conclude by explaining their significance. Some academic papers are review
                articles, in which the “data” are published papers and the “findings” are key insights, enduring lines
                of
                debate, and/or remaining unanswered questions. <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://libguides.geneseo.edu/scholarlyvspopular">Scholarly journals use a peer-review
                    process</a>
                to decide which articles merit publication. First, hopeful authors send their article manuscript to the
                journal editor, a role filled by some prominent scholar in the field. The editor reads over the
                manuscript
                and decides whether it seems worthy of peer-review. If it’s outside the interests of the journal or is
                clearly inadequate, the editor will reject it outright. If it looks appropriate and sufficiently high
                quality, the editor will recruit a few other experts in the field to act as anonymous peer reviewers.
                The
                editor will send the manuscript (scrubbed of identifying information) to the reviewers who will read it
                closely and provide a thorough critique. Is the research question driving the paper timely and
                important?
                Does the paper sufficiently and accurately review all of the relevant prior research? Are the
                information
                sources believable and the research methods rigorous? Are the stated results fully justified by the
                findings? Is the significance of the research clear? Is it well written? Overall, does the paper add
                new,
                trustworthy, and important knowledge to the field? Reviewers send their comments to the editor who then
                decides whether to (1) reject the manuscript, (2) ask the author(s) to revise and resubmit the
                manuscript<sup><a id="footnote-033-backlink" href="#footnote-033">7</a></sup>, or (3) accept it for
                publication. Editors send the reviewers’ comments (again, with no identifying information) to authors
                along
                with their decisions. A manuscript that has been revised and resubmitted usually goes out for
                peer-review
                again; editors often try to get reviews from one or two first-round reviewers as well as a new reviewer.
                The
                whole process, from start to finish, can easily take a year, and it is often another year before the
                paper
                appears in print. Understanding the academic publication process and the structure of scholarly articles
                tells you a lot about how to find, read and use these sources: <ol>
                    <li><em>Find them quickly</em>. Instead of paging through mountains of dubious web content, go right
                        to
                        the relevant scholarly article databases in order to quickly find the highest quality sources.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Use the abstracts</em>. Abstracts tell you immediately whether or not the article you’re
                        holding
                        is relevant or useful to the paper you’re assigned to write. You shouldn’t ever have the
                        experience
                        of reading the whole paper just to discover it’s not useful.</li>
                    <li><em>Read strategically</em>. Knowing the anatomy of a scholarly article tells you what you
                        should be
                        reading for in each section. For example, you don’t necessarily need to understand every nuance
                        of
                        the literature review. You can just focus on why the authors claim that their own study is
                        distinct
                        from the ones that came before.</li>
                    <li><em>Don’t sweat the technical stuff</em>. Not every social scientist understands the intricacies
                        of
                        log-linear modeling of quantitative survey data; however, the reviewers definitely do, and they
                        found the analysis to be well constructed. Thus, you can accept the findings as legitimate and
                        just
                        focus on the passages that explain the findings and their significance in plainer language.</li>
                    <li><em>Use one article to find others</em>. If you have one really good article that’s a few years
                        old,
                        you can use article databases to find newer articles that cited it in their own literature
                        reviews.
                        That immediately tells you which ones are on the same topic and offer newer findings. On the
                        other
                        hand, if your first source is very recent, the literature review section will describe the other
                        papers in the same line of research. You can look them up directly.</li>

                    <p class="Student-Voices">Research papers, amongst others, are the most common papers a college
                        student

                        papers
                        are my favorite kind of papers because of sourcing, paraphrasing, and quoting. Naturally as you

                </div> Students sometimes grumble when they’re ordered to use scholarly articles in their research. It
                seems
                a lot easier to just Google some terms and find stuff that way. However, academic articles are the most
                efficient resource out there. They are vetted by experts and structured specifically to help readers
                zero in
                on the most important passages. <h1>Finding Tier 1 sources: article databases</h1> Your campus library
                pays
                big money to subscribe to databases for Tier 1 articles. Some are general purpose databases that include
                the
                most prominent journals across disciplines<sup><a id="footnote-032-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-032">8</a></sup>, and some are specific to a particular discipline.<sup><a
                        id="footnote-031-backlink" href="#footnote-031">9</a></sup> Often they have the full-text of the
                articles right there for you to save or print. We won’t go over particular databases here because every
                campus has different offerings. If you haven’t already attended a workshop on using the resources
                provided
                by your library, you should. A one-hour workshop will save you many, many hours in the future. If there
                aren’t any workshops, you can always seek advice from librarians and other library staff on the best
                databases for your topic. Many libraries also have online research guides that point you to the best
                databases for the specific discipline and, perhaps, the specific course. Librarians are eager to help
                you
                succeed with your research—it’s their job and they love it!—so don’t be shy about asking. An
                increasingly
                popular article database is <a target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>. It
                looks like a regular Google search, and it aspires to include the vast majority of published
                scholarship.
                Google doesn’t share a list of which journals they include or how Google Scholar works, which limits its
                utility for scholars. Also, because it’s so wide-ranging, it can be harder to find the most appropriate
                sources. However, if you want to cast a wide net, it’s a very useful tool. Here are three tips for using
                Google Scholar effectively: <ol>
                    <li><em>Add your field (economics, psychology, French, etc.) as one of your keywords</em>. If you
                        just
                        put in “crime,” for example, Google Scholar will return all sorts of stuff from sociology,
                        psychology, geography, and history. If your paper is on crime in French literature, your best
                        sources may be buried under thousands of papers from other disciplines. A set of search terms
                        like
                        “crime French literature modern” will get you to relevant sources much faster.</li>
                    <li><em>Don’t ever pay for an article</em>. When you click on links to articles in Google Scholar,
                        you
                        may end up on a publisher’s site that tells you that you can download the article for $20 or
                        $30.
                        Don’t do it! You probably have access to virtually all the published academic literature through
                        your library resources. Write down the key information (authors’ names, title, journal title,
                        volume, issue number, year, page numbers) and go find the article through your library website.
                        If
                        you don’t have immediate full-text access, you may be able to get it through inter-library loan.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Use the “cited by” feature</em>. If you get one great hit on Google Scholar, you can quickly
                        see
                        a list of other papers that cited it. For example, the search terms “crime economics” yielded
                        this
                        hit for a 1988 paper that appeared in a journal called <em>Kyklos</em>:</li>

                nearly
                30 years ago; for a social-science paper you probably want more recent sources. You can see that,
                according
                to Google, this paper was cited by 392 other sources. You can click on that “Cited by 392” to see that
                list.
                You can even search within that list of 392 if you’re trying to narrow down the topic. For example, you
                could search on the term “cities” to see which of those 392 articles are most likely to be about the
                economic impact of crime on cities. <h1>Library research as problem-solving</h1> You’ll probably engage
                the
                subscription article databases at different points in the process. For example, imagine you’ve been
                assigned
                a research paper that can focus on any topic relevant to the course. Imagine further that you don’t have
                a
                clue about where to start and aren’t entirely sure what counts as an appropriate topic in this
                discipline. A
                great approach is to find the top journals in the specific field of your course and browse through
                recent
                issues to see what people are publishing on. For example, when I assign an open-topic research paper in
                my
                Introduction to Sociology course, I suggest that students looking for a topic browse recent issues of
                <em>Social Problems</em> or <em>American Journal of Sociology</em> and find an article that looks
                interesting. They’ll have a topic and—booyah!—their first source. An instructor of a class on
                kinesiology
                might recommend browsing <em>Human Movement Science</em>, the <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning
                    Research</em>, or <em>Perceptual and Motor Skills</em>. When you have a topic and are looking for a
                set
                of sources, your biggest challenge is finding the right keywords. You’ll never find the right sources
                without them. You’ll obviously start with words and phrases from the assignment prompt, but you can’t
                stop
                there. As explained above, lower tier sources (such as Wikipedia) or the top-tier sources you already
                have
                are great for identifying alternative keywords, and librarians and other library staff are also well
                practiced at finding new approaches to try. Librarians can also point you to the best databases for your
                topic as well. As you assess your evidence and further develop your thesis through the writing process,
                you
                may need to seek additional sources. For example, imagine you’re writing a paper about the added risks
                adolescents face when they have experienced their parents’ divorce. As you synthesize the evidence about
                negative impacts, you begin to wonder if scholars have documented some positive impacts as well.<sup><a
                        id="footnote-030-backlink" href="#footnote-030">10</a></sup> Thus you delve back into the
                literature
                to look for more articles, find some more concepts and keywords (such as “resiliency”), assess new
                evidence,
                and revise your thinking to account for these broader perspectives. Your instructor may have asked you
                to
                turn in a bibliography weeks before the final paper draft. You can check with your professor, but he or
                she
                is probably perfectly fine with you seeking additional sources as your thinking evolves. That’s how
                scholars
                write. Finding good sources is a much more creative task than it seems on the face of it. It’s an
                extended
                problem-solving exercise, an iterative cycle of questions and answers. Go ahead and use Wikipedia to get
                broadly informed if you want. It won’t corrupt your brain. But use it, and all other sources,
                strategically.
                You should eventually arrive at a core set of Tier 1 sources that will enable you to make a well
                informed
                and thoughtful argument in support of your thesis. It’s also a good sign when you find yourself deciding
                that some of the first sources you found are no longer relevant to your thesis; that likely means that
                you
                have revised and specified your thinking and are well on your way to constructing the kind of
                self-driven
                in-depth analysis that your professor is looking for. <div class="textbox examples">

                <h1>Theses and sources</h1> Everyone knows that a thorough analysis and persuasive argument needs strong

                    4</a>, is one key element of strong evidence, but it also matters how sources are used in the text
                of
                the paper. Many students are accustomed to thinking of sources simply as expert corroboration for their
                own
                points. As a result, they tend to comb texts to find statements that closely parallel what they want to
                say
                and then incorporate quotes as evidence that a published author agrees with them. That’s one way to use
                sources, but there is a lot more to it. Recall from prior chapters that writing academic papers is about
                joining a conversation. You’re contributing your own original thinking to some complex problem, be it
                interpretive, theoretical, or practical. Citing sources helps situate your ideas within that ongoing
                conversation. Sometimes you’re citing a research finding that provides strong evidence for your point;
                at
                other times you’re summarizing someone else’s ideas in order to explain how your own opinion differs or
                to
                note how someone else’s concept applies to a new situation. <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/subject-detail.aspx?tid=522&amp;sortparam=SortTitle">Graff and

                think about writing with sources is a “They Say/I Say” process. You first report what “they” say; “they”
                being published authors, prevalent ideas in society at large, or maybe participants in some kind of
                political or social debate. Then you respond by explaining what you think: Do you agree? Disagree? A
                little
                of both? This “They Say/I Say” approach can help student writers find balance in their use of sources.
                On
                one extreme, some students think that they aren’t allowed to make any claims without citing one or more
                expert authors saying the same thing. When their instructors encourage them to bring more original
                thinking
                into their writing, they’re confused about how to do it. On the other extreme, some students tend to
                describe, more or less accurately, what sources say about a topic but then go on to state opinions that
                seem
                unrelated to the claims they just summarized. For example, a student writer may draw on expert sources
                to
                explain how the prevention and early detection of cancer has saved lives<sup><a
                        id="footnote-052-backlink" href="#footnote-052">2</a></sup> but then argue for more funding for
                curing advanced cancer without
                making any explicit link to the points about prevention and screening. On one extreme, the sources are
                allowed to crowd out original thinking; on the other, they have seemingly no impact on the author’s
                conclusions. How can you know when you’re avoiding both of these extremes? In other words, what kinds of
                <a target="_blank" href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/thesis-statements/">theses</a> (“I Say”)
                can
                count as an original claim and still be grounded in the sources (“They Say”)? Here are five common
                strategies: <ol>
                    <li><em>Combine research findings from multiple sources to make a larger summary argument</em>. You
                        might find that none of the sources you’re working with specifically claim that early 20th
                        century
                        British literature was preoccupied with changing gender roles but that, together, their findings
                        all
                        point to that broader conclusion.</li>
                    <li><em>Combine research findings from multiple sources to make a claim about their
                            implications</em>.
                        You might review papers that explore various factors shaping voting behavior to argue that a
                        particular voting-reform proposal will likely have positive impacts.</li>
                    <li><em>Identify underlying areas of agreement</em>. You may argue that the literature on cancer and
                        the
                        literature on violence both describe the unrecognized importance of prevention and early
                        intervention in order to claim that insights about one set of problems may be useful for the
                        other.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Identify underlying areas of disagreement</em>. You may find that the controversies
                        surrounding
                        educational reform—and its debates about accountability, curricula, school funding—ultimately
                        stem
                        from different assumptions about the role of schools in society.</li>
                    <li><em>Identify unanswered questions</em>. Perhaps you review studies of the genetic and behavioral
                        contributors to diabetes in order to highlight unknown factors and argue for more in-depth
                        research
                        on the role of the environment.</li>
                </ol> There are certainly other ways authors use sources to build theses, but these examples illustrate
                how
                original thinking in academic writing involves making connections with and between a strategically
                chosen
                set of sources. <h1>Incorporating sources</h1> Here’s a passage of academic writing (an excerpt, not a
                complete paper) that illustrates several ways that sources can figure into a “They Say/I Say”
                approach<sup><a id="footnote-051-backlink" href="#footnote-051">3</a></sup>: <blockquote><a

                    draws on cognitive science to explain that students must be able to regulate their emotions in order
                    to
                    learn. Emotional self-regulation enables students to ignore distractions and channel their attention
                    and
                    behaviors in appropriate ways. Other research findings confirm that anxiety interferes with learning
                    and
                    academic performance because it makes distractions harder to resist (<a target="_blank"

                        2011</a>). Other cognitive scientists point out that deep learning is itself stressful because
                    it
                    requires people to think hard about complex, unfamiliar material instead of relying on cognitive
                    short-cuts. <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://us.macmillan.com/thinkingfastandslow/DanielKahneman">Kahneman (2011)</a> describes
                    this
                    difference in terms of two systems for thinking: one fast and one slow. Fast thinking is based on
                    assumptions and habits and doesn’t require a lot of effort. For example, driving a familiar route or
                    a
                    routine grocery-shopping trip are not usually intellectually taxing activities. Slow thinking, on
                    the
                    other hand, is what we do when we encounter novel problems and situations. It’s effortful, and it
                    usually feels tedious and confusing. It is emotionally challenging as well because we are, by
                    definition, incompetent while we’re doing it, which provokes some anxiety. Solving a tough problem
                    is
                    rewarding, but the path itself is often unpleasant. These insights from cognitive science enable us
                    to
                    critically assess the claims made on both sides of the education reform debate. On one hand, they
                    cast
                    doubt on the claims of education reformers that measuring teachers’ performance by student test
                    scores
                    is the best way to improve education. For example, the <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://www.edreform.com/">Center for Education Reform</a> promotes “the implementation of
                    strong, data-driven, performance-based accountability systems that ensure teachers are rewarded,
                    retained and advanced based on how they perform in adding value to the students who they teach,
                    measured
                    predominantly by student achievement” (<a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.edreform.com/issues/teacher-quality/">http://www.edreform.com/issues/teacher-quality/#what-we-believe</a>).
                    The research that Willingham (2011) and Kahneman (2011) describe suggests that frequent high-stakes
                    testing may actually work against learning by introducing greater anxiety into the school
                    environment.
                    At the same time, opponents of education reform should acknowledge that these research findings
                    should
                    prompt us to take a fresh look at how we educate our children. While Stan Karp of <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://www.rethinkingschools.org/index.shtml">Rethinking Schools</a> is correct when he
                    argues
                    that “data-driven formulas [based on standardized testing] lack both statistical credibility and a
                    basic
                    understanding of the human motivations and relationships that make good schooling possible” (<a
                        target="_blank"
                        href="http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/26_03/26_03_karp.shtm">http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/26_03/26_03_karp.shtm</a>),
                    it doesn’t necessarily follow that all education reform proposals lack merit. Challenging standards,
                    together with specific training in emotional self-regulation, will likely enable more students to
                    succeed.<sup><a id="footnote-050-backlink" href="#footnote-050">4</a></sup></blockquote> In that
                example, the ideas of Willingham and Kahneman are summarized approvingly, bolstered with additional
                research
                findings, and then applied to a new realm: the current debate surrounding education reform. Voices in
                that
                debate were portrayed as accurately as possible, sometimes with representative quotes. Most importantly,
                all
                references were tied directly to the author’s own interpretative point, which relies on the quoted
                claims.

                        <p class="Student-Voices">I think the most important lesson for me to learn about sources was
                            that
                            the best way to use them is to create a new point. What I mean by this is instead of using
                            them
                            only to back up your points, create your own conclusion from what your sources say. As a
                            psychology major, I look at a lot of data from researchers who have created a conclusion
                            from a
                            meta-analysis (a combination of many studies about the same thing). So that’s how I like to
                            think of using sources, I will look at many articles about the same subject and then come up
                            with my own opinion. After using your sources, it is very important to cite them <span
                                class="bolditalics">correctly</span>. Personally, I want to be a respected and
                            trustworthy
                            scholar. However, if any of my papers were to be found without proper citations, all of my
                            hard
                            work would be for nothing and people would be wary about the rest of my work.</p>

                    </div>
                </div> As you can see, there are times when you should quote or paraphrase sources that you don’t agree
                with
                or do not find particularly compelling. They may convey ideas and opinions that help explain and justify
                your own argument. Similarly, when you cite sources that you agree with, you should choose quotes or
                paraphrases that serve as building blocks within your own argument. Regardless of the role each source
                plays
                in your writing, you certainly don’t need to find whole sentences or passages that express your
                thinking.
                Rather, focus on what each of those sources is claiming, why, and how exactly their claims relate to
                your
                own points. The remainder of this chapter explains some key principles for incorporating sources,
                principles
                which follow from the general point that academic writing is about entering an ongoing conversation.
                <h2>
                    Principle 1: Listen to your sources</h2> Have you ever had the maddening experience of arguing with
                someone who twisted your words to make it seem like you were saying something you weren’t? Novice
                writers
                sometimes inadvertently misrepresent their sources when they quote very minor points from an article or
                even
                positions that the authors of an article disagree with. It often happens when students approach their
                sources with the goal of finding snippets that align with their own opinion. For example, the passage
                above
                contains the phrase “measuring teachers’ performance by student test scores is the best way to improve
                education.” An inexperienced writer might include that quote in a paper without making it clear that the
                author(s) of the source actually dispute that very claim. Doing so is not intentionally fraudulent, but
                it
                reveals that the paper-writer isn’t really thinking about and responding to claims and arguments made by
                others. In that way, it harms his or her credibility. Academic journal articles are especially likely to
                be
                misrepresented by student writers because their literature review sections often summarize a number of
                contrasting viewpoints. For example, sociologists Jennifer C. Lee and Jeremy Staff wrote a paper in
                which
                they note that high-schoolers who spend more hours at a job are more likely to drop out of
                school.<sup><a id="footnote-049-backlink" href="#footnote-049">5</a></sup> However, Lee and Staff’s
                analysis finds
                that working more hours doesn’t actually make a student more likely to drop out. Instead, the students
                who
                express less interest in school are both more likely to work a lot of hours <em>and</em> more likely to
                drop
                out. In short, Lee and Staff argue that disaffection with school causes students to drop-out, not
                working at
                a job. In reviewing prior research about the impact of work on dropping out, Lee and Staff write “Paid
                work,
                especially when it is considered intensive, reduces grade point averages, time spent on homework,
                educational aspirations, and the likelihood of completing high school”<sup><a id="footnote-048-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-048">6</a></sup>. If you included that quote without explaining how it fits into
                Lee
                and Staff’s actual argument, you would be misrepresenting that source. <h2>Principle 2: Provide context
                </h2>
                Another error beginners often make is to drop in a quote without any context. If you simply quote,
                “Students
                begin preschool with a set of self-regulation skills that are a product of their genetic inheritance and
                their family environment” (Willingham, 2011, p.24), your reader is left wondering who Willingham is, why
                he
                or she is included here, and where this statement fits into his or her larger work. The whole point of
                incorporating sources is to situate your own insights in the conversation. As part of that, you should
                provide some kind of context the first time you use that source. Some examples: <blockquote>
                    <div>Willingham, a cognitive scientist, claims that …</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Research in cognitive science has found that … (Willingham, 2011).</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Willingham argues that “Students begin preschool with a set of self-regulation skills that are
                        a
                        product of their genetic inheritance and their family environment” (Willingham, 2011, p.24).
                        Drawing
                        on findings in cognitive science, he explains “…”</div>
                </blockquote> As the second example above shows, providing a context doesn’t mean writing a brief
                biography
                of every author in your bibliography—it just means including some signal about why that source is
                included
                in your text. Even more baffling to your reader is when quoted material does not fit into the flow of
                the
                text. For example, a novice student might write, <blockquote>
                    <div>Schools and parents shouldn’t set limits on how much teenagers are allowed to work at jobs. “We
                        conclude that intensive work does not affect the likelihood of high school dropout among youths
                        who
                        have a high propensity to spend long hours on the job” (Lee and Staff, 2007, p. 171). Teens
                        should
                        be trusted to learn how to manage their time.</div>
                </blockquote> The reader is thinking, who is this sudden, ghostly “we”? Why should this source be
                believed?
                If you find that passages with quotes in your draft are awkward to read out loud, that’s a sign that you
                need to contextualize the quote more effectively. Here’s a version that puts the quote in context:
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Schools and parents shouldn’t set limits on how much teenagers are allowed to work at jobs. Lee
                        and
                        Staff’s carefully designed study found that “intensive work does not affect the likelihood of
                        high
                        school dropout among youths who have a high propensity to spend long hours on the job” (2007, p.
                        171). Teens should be trusted to learn how to manage their time.</div>
                </blockquote> In this latter example, it’s now clear that Lee and Staff are scholars and that their
                empirical study is being used as evidence for this argumentative point. Using a source in this way
                invites
                the reader to check out Lee and Staff’s work for themselves if they doubt this claim. Many writing
                instructors encourage their students to contextualize their use of sources by making a “<a
                    target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.umass.edu/writingprogram/teaching/database/Quotation%20Sandwich.dwt">quotation
                    sandwich</a>”; that is, introduce the quote in some way and then follow it up with your own words.
                If
                you’ve made a bad habit of dropping in unintroduced quotes, the quotation sandwich idea may help you
                improve
                your skills, but in general you don’t need to approach every quote or paraphrase as a three-part
                structure
                to have well integrated sources. You should, however, avoid ending a paragraph with a quotation. If
                you’re
                struggling to figure out what to write after a quote or close paraphrase, it may be that you haven’t yet
                figured out what role the quote is playing in your own analysis. If that happens to you a lot, try
                writing
                the whole first draft in your own words and then incorporate material from sources as you revise with
                “They
                Say/I Say” in mind. <h2>Principle 3: Use sources efficiently</h2> Some student writers are in a rut of
                only
                quoting whole sentences. Some others, like myself as a student, get overly enamored of extended block
                quotes
                and the scholarly look they give to the page.<sup><a id="footnote-047-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-047">7</a></sup> These aren’t the worst sins of academic writing, but they get
                in
                the way of one of the key principles of writing with sources: shaping quotes and paraphrases
                efficiently.
                Efficiency follows from the second principle, because when you fully incorporate sources into your own
                explicit argument, you zero in on the phrases, passages, and ideas that are relevant to your points.
                It’s a
                very good sign for your paper when most quotes are short (key terms, phrases, or parts of sentences) and
                the
                longer quotes (whole sentences and passages) are clearly justified by the discussion in which they’re
                embedded. Every bit of every quote should feel indispensable to the paper. An overabundance of long
                quotes
                usually means that your own argument is undeveloped. The most incandescent quotes will not hide that
                fact
                from your professor. Also, some student writers forget that quoting is not the only way to incorporate
                sources. <a target="_blank" href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/563/02/">Paraphasing</a>
                and
                summarizing are sophisticated skills that are often more appropriate to use than direct quoting. The
                first
                two paragraphs of the example passage above do not include any quotations, even though they are both
                clearly
                focused on presenting the work of others. Student writers may avoid paraphrasing out of fear of
                plagiarizing, and it’s true that a poorly executed paraphrase will make it seem like the student writer
                is
                fraudulently claiming the wordsmithing work of others as his or her own. Sticking to direct quotes seems
                safer. However, it is worth your time to master <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/563/02/">paraphasing</a> because it often helps
                you be
                more clear and concise, drawing out only those elements that are relevant to the thread of your
                analysis.
                For example, here’s a passage from a hypothetical paper with a block quote that is fully relevant to the
                argument but, nevertheless, inefficient: <blockquote>
                    <div>Drawing on a lifetime of research, Kahneman concludes our brains are prone to error:<sup><a
                                id="footnote-046-backlink" href="#footnote-046">8</a></sup></div>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="Text---Headings_Block-quote-2">System 1 registers the cognitive ease with which it processes
                    information, but it does not generate a warning signal when it becomes unreliable. Intuitive answers
                    come to mind quickly and confidently, whether they originate from skills or from heuristics. There
                    is no
                    simple way for System 2 to distinguish between a skilled and a heuristic response. Its only recourse
                    is
                    to slow down and attempt to construct an answer on its own, which it is reluctant to do because it
                    is
                    indolent. Many suggestions of System 1 are casually endorsed with minimal checking, as in the
                    bat-and-ball problem.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>While people can get better at recognizing and avoiding these errors, Kahneman suggests, the
                        more
                        robust solutions involve developing procedures within organizations to promote careful,
                        effortful
                        thinking in making important decisions and judgments.</div>
                </blockquote> Even a passage that is important to reference and is well contextualized in the flow of
                the
                paper will be inefficient if it introduces terms and ideas that aren’t central to the analysis within
                the
                paper. Imagine, for example, that other parts of this hypothetical paper use Kahneman’s other terms for
                System 1 (fast thinking) and System 2 (slow thinking); the sudden encounter of “System 1” and “System 2”
                would be confusing and tedious for your reader. Similarly, the terms “heuristics” and “bat-and-ball
                problem”
                might be unfamiliar to your reader. Their presence in the block quote just muddies the waters. In this
                case,
                a paraphrase is a much better choice. Here’s an example passage that uses a paraphrase to establish the
                same
                points more clearly and efficiently: <blockquote>
                    <div>Drawing on a lifetime of research, Kahneman summarizes that our brains are prone to error
                        because
                        they necessarily rely on cognitive shortcuts that may or may not yield valid judgments.<sup><a
                                id="footnote-045-backlink" href="#footnote-045">9</a></sup> We have the capacity to stop
                        and
                        examine our assumptions, Kahneman points out, but we often want to avoid that hard work. As a
                        result, we tend to accept our quick, intuitive responses. While people can get better at
                        recognizing
                        and avoiding these errors, Kahneman suggests that the more robust solutions involve developing
                        procedures within organizations to promote careful, effortful thinking in making important
                        decisions
                        and judgments.</div>
                </blockquote> Not only is the paraphrased version shorter (97 words versus 151), it is clearer and more
                efficient because it highlights the key ideas, avoiding specific terms and examples that aren’t used in
                the
                rest of the paper. If other parts of your paper did refer to Kahneman’s System 1 and System 2, then you
                might choose to include some quoted phrases to make use of some of Kahneman’s great language. Perhaps
                something like this: <blockquote>
                    <div>Drawing on a lifetime of research, Kahneman summarizes that our brains are prone to error

                        examine these assumptions, but it
                        usually wants to avoid that hard work. As a result, our quick, intuitive responses are “casually
                        endorsed with minimal checking.” <sup><a id="footnote-042-backlink"
                                href="#footnote-042">12</a></sup> While people can get better at recognizing and

                </blockquote> Whether you choose a long quote, short quote, paraphrase or summary depends on the role
                that
                the source in playing in your analysis. The trick is to make deliberate, thoughtful decisions about how
                to
                incorporate ideas and words from others. Paraphrasing, summarizing, and the mechanical conventions of
                quoting take a lot of practice to master. Numerous other resources (like those listed at the end of this
                chapter) explain these practices clearly and succinctly. Bookmark some good sources and refer to them as
                needed. If you suspect that you’re in a quoting rut, try out some new ways of incorporating sources.

                    Principle 4: Choose precise verbs of attribution</h2> It’s time to get beyond the all-purpose
                “says.”
                And please don’t look up “says” in the thesaurus and substitute verbs like “proclaim” (unless there was
                actually a proclamation) or “pronounce” (unless there was actually a pronouncement). Here’s a list of 15
                useful alternatives:<sup><a id="footnote-041-backlink" href="#footnote-041">13</a></sup>

                more
                with fewer words. For one thing, they can quickly convey what kind of idea you’re citing: a speculative
                one
                (“postulates”)? A conclusive one (“determines”)? A controversial one (“counters”)? You can further show
                how
                you’re incorporating these sources into your own narrative. For example, if you write that an author
                “claims” something, you’re presenting yourself as fairly neutral about that claim. If you instead write
                that
                the author “shows” something, then you signal to your reader that you find that evidence more
                convincing.
                “Suggests” on the other hand is a much weaker endorsement. As I’ll discuss in <a target="_blank"

                <h1>Conclusion</h1> Like so many things in adult life, writing in college is often both more liberating
                and
                burdensome than writing in high school and before. On the one hand, I’ve had students tell me that their
                high-school experiences made it seem that their own opinions didn’t matter in academic writing, and that
                they can’t make any claims that aren’t exactly paralleled by a pedigreed quotation. Writing papers based
                on
                their own insights and opinions can seem freeing in contrast. At the same time, a college student
                attending
                full time may be expected to have original and well considered ideas about pre-Columbian Latin American
                history, congressional redistricting, sports in society, post-colonial literatures, and nano-technology,
                all
                in about two weeks. Under these conditions, it’s easy to see why some would long for the days when
                simple,
                competent reporting did the job. You probably won’t have an authentic intellectual engagement with every
                college writing assignment, but approaching your written work as an opportunity to dialogue with the
                material can help you find the momentum you need to succeed with this work. <div

                            id="footnote-040-backlink" href="#footnote-040">14</a></sup>
                    <blockquote>
                        <div>Like so many things desired by Europeans and supplied by Asians—at first luxury items for
                            the
                            elite such as silk or porcelain, but increasingly products like tea from China for the mass
                            market—cotton textiles were produced well and cheaply in India. The British textile
                            manufacturers focused on the “cheap” part and complained that with relatively higher wages,
                            British manufacturers could not compete. India had a competitive advantage in the eighteenth
                            century, being able to undersell in the world market virtually any other producer of
                            textiles.
                            Some thought the reason for cheap Indian textiles was because of a low living standard, or a
                            large population earning depressed wages, but all of those have been shown to not be true:
                            Indian textile workers in the eighteenth century had just as high a standard of living as
                            British workers. So, if it was not a low standard of living that gave India its competitive
                            advance, what did?</div>
                        <div>In a word: agriculture. Indian agriculture was so productive that the amount of food
                            produced,
                            and hence its cost, was significantly lower than in Europe. In the preindustrial age, when
                            working families spent 60-80 percent of their earnings on food, the cost of food was the
                            primary
                            determinant of their real wages (i.e. how much a pound, dollar, a real, or a pagoda could
                            buy).
                            In India (and China and Japan as well), the amount of grain harvested from a given amount of
                            seed was in the ration of 20:1 (e.g., twenty bushels of rice harvested for every one
                            planted),
                            whereas in England it was at best 8:1. Asian agriculture thus was more than twice as
                            efficient
                            as British (and by extension European) agriculture, and food—the major component in the cost
                            of
                            living—cost less in Asia.</div>

                <h1 class="Text---Headings_Chapter-Number">Paragraphs</h1> As Michael Harvey writes, paragraphs are “in
                essence—a form of punctuation, and like other forms of punctuation they are meant to make written
                material
                easy to read.” <sup><a id="footnote-066-backlink" href="#footnote-066">1</a></sup> Effective paragraphs
                are
                the fundamental units of academic writing; consequently, the thoughtful, multifaceted arguments that
                your
                professors expect depend on them. Without good paragraphs, you simply cannot clearly convey sequential
                points and their relationships to one another. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight strategies
                for
                constructing, ordering, and relating paragraphs in academic writing. It could just as well be titled
                “Organization” because whether or not readers perceive a paper to be well organized depends largely on
                effective paragraphing. Many novice writers tend to make a sharp distinction between content and style,
                thinking that a paper can be strong in one and weak in the other, but focusing on organization shows how
                content and style converge in deliberative academic writing. A poorly organized paper may contain
                insightful
                kernels, but a thoughtful, satisfying argument can’t take shape without paragraphs that are crafted,
                ordered, and connected effectively. On the other side, one can imagine a string of slick, error-free
                sentences that are somehow lacking in interesting ideas. However, your professors will view even the
                most
                elegant prose as rambling and tedious if there isn’t a careful, coherent argument to give the text
                meaning.
                Paragraphs are the “stuff” of academic writing and, thus, worth our attention here. <h1>Key sentences
                    (a.k.a. topic sentences)</h1> In academic writing, readers expect each paragraph to have a sentence
                or
                two that captures its main point. They’re often called “topic sentences,” though many writing
                instructors
                prefer to call them “key sentences.” There are at least two downsides of the phrase “topic sentence.”
                First,
                it makes it seem like the paramount job of that sentence is simply to announce the topic of the
                paragraph.
                Second, it makes it seem like the topic sentence must always be a single grammatical sentence. Calling
                it a
                “key sentence” reminds us that it expresses the central <em>idea</em> of the paragraph. And sometimes a
                question or a two-sentence construction functions as the key. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">
                    <div class="Blurb" id="_idContainer027">
                        <p class="Student-Voices">The key to staying on topic within a paragraph is starting with a
                            topic
                            sentence. It doesn’t even have to be perfect to work from it! Just figure out what you
                            really
                            want to say in that one specific paragraph and go. Then, you … EDIT (haha, made you flinch!)
                            All
                            joking aside, editing really is a very important step in this process. By going back over
                            what
                            you wrote, you can check to see if what you wrote in that paragraph fits with what you
                            actually
                            intend to say as well as to make sure everything is cohesive and coherent!</p>

                    </div>
                </div> Key sentences in academic writing do two things. First, they establish the main point that the
                rest
                of the paragraph supports. Second, they situate each paragraph within the sequence of the argument, a
                task
                that requires transitioning from the prior paragraph. Consider these two examples: <sup><a

                        etiological studies.</div>
                </blockquote> Both versions convey a topic; it’s pretty easy to predict that the paragraph will be about
                epidemiological evidence, but only the second version establishes an argumentative point and puts it in
                context. The paragraph doesn’t just describe the epidemiological evidence; it shows how epidemiology is
                telling the same story as etiology. Similarly, while Version A doesn’t relate to anything in particular,
                Version B immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the biological pathway (i.e. etiology)
                of
                a disease and that the new paragraph will bolster the emerging hypothesis with a different kind of
                evidence.
                As a reader, it’s easy to keep track of how the paragraph about cells and chemicals and such relates to
                the
                paragraph about populations in different places. By clearly establishing an essential point within its
                analytic context, a well written key sentence gives both you and your reader a firm grasp of how each
                point
                relates. For example, compare these two sets of key sentences, each introducing a sequential
                paragraph<sup><a id="footnote-064-backlink" href="#footnote-064">3</a></sup>: <h4>Version A:</h4>

                        that the pathogenesis of HIV was still unknown. …</div>
                </blockquote> Version A isn’t wrong per se; it just illustrates a lost opportunity to show the important
                connections among points. Both versions portray a process unfolding over time: initial uncertainty
                followed
                by a breakthrough discovery and then controversy. Even with the same substantive points, a person
                reading
                Version A would have to work harder to see how the material in the paragraphs connects. Readers
                experience
                Version B as clearer and more engaging. Thinking of key sentences as sequential points in an argument
                reminds one that a key sentence doesn’t have to always be a single declarative one. Sometimes you need
                two
                sentences together to achieve the work of a key sentence, and sometimes a question or quotation does a
                better job than a declarative sentence in clarifying a logical sequence: <h4>Version C:</h4>

                </blockquote> Version C is based on the same three sequential points as Versions A and B: (1) the cause
                of
                AIDS was initially unclear (2) HIV was accepted as the cause (3) lone dissenters questioned the claims.
                However, versions B and C have much more meaning and momentum, and version C, depending on the nature of
                the
                argument, features more precise and lively stylistic choices. Opening the second paragraph with a
                question
                (that then gets answered) carries forth the sense of befuddlement that researchers initially experienced
                and
                helps to convey why the discovery of HIV was a hugely important turning point. Using the self-glorifying
                Duesberg quote to launch the third paragraph makes the point about lingering skepticism while also
                introducing a portrait of a leading figure among the skeptics. While Version B is effective as well,
                Version
                C illustrates some of the more lively choices available to academic writers. A last thing to note about
                key
                sentences is that academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph.<sup><a
                        id="footnote-062-backlink" href="#footnote-062">5</a></sup> That helps readers comprehend your
                argument. To see how, try this: find an academic piece (such as a textbook or scholarly article) that
                strikes you as well written and go through part of it reading just the first sentence of each paragraph.
                You
                should be able to easily follow the sequence of logic. When you’re writing for professors, it is
                especially
                effective to put your key sentences first because they usually convey your own original thinking, which,
                as
                you’ve read here, is exactly what your instructors are looking for in your work. It’s a very good sign
                when
                your paragraphs are typically composed of a telling key sentence followed by evidence and explanation.
                Knowing this convention of academic writing can help you both read and write more effectively. When
                you’re
                reading a complicated academic piece for the first time, you might want to go through reading only the
                first
                sentence or two of each paragraph to get the overall outline of the argument. Then you can go back and
                read
                all of it with a clearer picture of how each of the details fit in.<sup><a id="footnote-061-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-061">6</a></sup> And when you’re writing, you may also find it useful to write
                the
                first sentence of each paragraph (instead of a topic-based outline) to map out a thorough argument
                before
                getting immersed in sentence-level wordsmithing. For example, compare these two scaffolds. Which one

                        useful
                        in job hunting because they connect job-seekers to a broader range of people and workplaces. …

                            writing my first sentence of each paragraph as my plan. This way, you know what to write

                <h1>Cohesion and coherence</h1> With a key sentence established, the next task is to shape the body of
                your
                paragraph to be both cohesive and coherent. As Williams and Bizup<sup><a id="footnote-059-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-059">8</a></sup> explain, cohesion is about the “sense of flow” (how each
                sentence
                fits with the next), while coherence is about the “sense of the whole”.<sup><a
                        id="footnote-058-backlink" href="#footnote-058">9</a></sup> Some students worry too much about
                “flow” and spend a lot of time
                on sentence-level issues to promote it. I encourage you to focus on underlying structure. For the most
                part,
                a text reads smoothly when it conveys a thoughtful and well organized argument or analysis. Focus first
                and
                most on your ideas, on crafting an ambitious analysis. The most useful guides advise you to first focus
                on
                getting your ideas on paper and then revising for organization and wordsmithing later, refining the
                analysis
                as you go. Thus, I discuss creating cohesion and coherent paragraphs here as if you already have some
                rough
                text written and are in the process of smoothing out your prose to clarify your argument for both your
                reader and yourself. Cohesion refers to the flow from sentence to sentence. For example, compare these
                passages: <h4>Version A (That I Rewrote):</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Granovetter begins by looking at balance theory. If an actor, A, is strongly tied to both B and
                        C,
                        it is extremely likely that B and C are, sooner or later, going to be tied to each other,
                        according
                        to balance theory (1973:1363).<sup><a id="footnote-057-backlink"

                        Bridge ties between cliques are always weak ties, Granovetter argues (1973:1364). Weak ties may
                        not
                        necessarily be bridges, but Granovetter argues that bridges will be weak. If two actors share a
                        strong tie, they will draw in their other strong relations and will eventually form a clique.
                        Only
                        weak ties that do not have the strength to draw together all the “friends of friends” can
                        connect
                        people in different cliques.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <h4>Version B (The Original By Giuffre):</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Granovetter begins by looking at balance theory. In brief, balance theory tells us that if an
                        actor, A, is strongly tied to both B and C, it is extremely likely that B and C are, sooner or
                        later, going to be tied to each other (1973:1363). Granovetter argues that because of this,
                        bridge
                        ties between cliques are always weak ties (1973:1364). Weak ties may not necessarily be bridges,
                        but
                        Granovetter argues that bridges will be weak. This is because if two actors share a strong tie,
                        they
                        will draw in their other strong relations and will eventually form a clique. The only way,
                        therefore, that people in different cliques can be connected is through weak ties that do not
                        have
                        the strength to draw together all the “friends of friends.” <sup><a id="footnote-056-backlink"
                                href="#footnote-056">11</a></sup></div>
                </blockquote> Version A has the exact same information as version B, but it is harder to read because it
                is
                less cohesive. Each sentence in version B begins with old information and bridges to new information.
                Here’s
                Version B again with the relevant parts emboldened: <blockquote>
                    <div>Granovetter begins by looking at balance theory. In brief, balance theory tells us that if an
                        actor, A, is strongly tied to both B and C, it is extremely likely that B and C are, sooner or
                        later, going to be tied to each other (1973:1363). Granovetter argues that because of this,
                        bridge
                        ties between cliques are always weak ties (1973:1364). Weak ties may not necessarily be bridges,
                        but
                        Granovetter argues that bridges will be weak. This is because if two actors share a strong tie,
                        they
                        will draw in their other strong relations and will eventually form a clique. The only way,
                        therefore, that people in different cliques can be connected is through weak ties that do not
                        have
                        the strength to draw together all the “friends of friends.”</div>
                </blockquote> The first sentence establishes the key idea of balance theory. The next sentence begins
                with
                balance theory and ends with social ties, which is the focus of the third sentence. The concept of weak
                ties
                connects the third and fourth sentences and concept of cliques the fifth and sixth sentences. In Version
                A,
                in contrast, the first sentence focuses on balance theory, but then the second sentence makes a new
                point
                about social ties <em>before</em> telling the reader that the point comes from balance theory. The
                reader
                has to take in a lot of unfamiliar information before learning how it fits in with familiar concepts.
                Version A is coherent, but the lack of cohesion makes it tedious to read. The lesson is this: if you or
                others perceive a passage you’ve written to be awkward or choppy, even though the topic is consistent,
                try
                rewriting it to ensure that each sentence begins with a familiar term or concept. If your points don’t
                naturally daisy-chain together like the examples given here, consider numbering them. For example, you
                may
                choose to write, “Proponents of the legislation point to four major benefits.” Then you could discuss
                four
                loosely related ideas without leaving your reader wondering how they relate. While <a target="_blank"

                    sense of flow; coherence is about the sense of the whole</a>. For example, here’s a passage that is
                cohesive (from sentence to sentence) but lacks coherence: <blockquote>
                    <div>Your social networks and your location within them shape the kinds and amount of information
                        that
                        you have access to. Information is distinct from data, in that makes some kind of generalization
                        about a person, thing, or population. Defensible generalizations about society can be either
                        probabilities (i.e., statistics) or patterns (often from qualitative analysis). Such
                        probabilities
                        and patterns can be temporal, spatial, or simultaneous.</div>
                </blockquote> Each sentence in the above passage starts with a familiar idea and progresses to a new
                one,
                but it lacks coherence—a sense of being about one thing. Good writers often write passages like that
                when
                they’re free-writing or using the drafting stage to cast a wide net for ideas. A writer weighing the
                power
                and limits of social network analysis may free-write something like that example and, from there,
                develop a
                more specific plan for summarizing key insights about social networks and then discussing them with
                reference to the core tenets of social science. As a draft, an incoherent paragraph often points to a
                productive line of reasoning; one just has to continue thinking it through in order to identify a clear
                argumentative purpose for each paragraph. With its purpose defined, each paragraph, then, becomes a lot
                easier to write. Coherent paragraphs aren’t just about style; they are a sign of a thoughtful, well
                developed analysis. <h1>The wind-up</h1> <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.hamilton.edu/writing/writing-resources/paragraph-structure">Some guides advise you
                    to
                    end each paragraph with a specific concluding sentence</a>, in a sense, to treat each paragraph as a
                kind of mini-essay. But that’s not a widely held convention. Most well written academic pieces don’t
                adhere
                to that structure. The last sentence of the paragraph should certainly be in your own words (as in, not
                a
                quote), but as long as the paragraph succeeds in carrying out the task that it has been assigned by its
                key
                sentence, you don’t need to worry about whether that last sentence has an air of conclusiveness. For
                example, consider these paragraphs about the <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion">cold fusion controversy of the 1980s</a> that
                appeared
                in a best-selling textbook<sup><a id="footnote-055-backlink" href="#footnote-055">12</a></sup>:
                <blockquote>
                    <div>The experiment seemed straightforward and there were plenty of scientists willing to try it.
                        Many
                        did. It was wonderful to have a simple laboratory experiment on fusion to try after the decades
                        of
                        embarrassing attempts to control hot fusion. This effort required multi-billion dollar machines
                        whose every success seemed to be capped with an unanticipated failure. ‘Cold fusion’ seemed to
                        provide, as Martin Fleischmann said during the course of that famous Utah press conference,
                        ‘another
                        route’—the route of little science.</div>
                </blockquote> In that example, the first and last sentences in the paragraph are somewhat symmetrical:
                the
                authors introduce the idea of accessible science, contrast it with big science, and bring it back to the
                phrase “little science.” Here’s an example from the same chapter of the same book that does not have any
                particular symmetry<sup><a id="footnote-054-backlink" href="#footnote-054">13</a></sup>: <blockquote>
                    <div>The struggle between proponents and critics in a scientific controversy is always a struggle
                        for
                        credibility. When scientists make claims which are literally ‘incredible’, as in the cold fusion
                        case, they face an uphill struggle. The problem Pons and Fleischmann had to overcome was that
                        they
                        had credibility as electrochemists but not as nuclear physicists. And it was nuclear physics
                        where
                        their work was likely to have its main impact.</div>
                </blockquote> The last sentence of the paragraph doesn’t mirror the first, but the paragraph still works
                just fine. In general, every sentence of academic writing should add some unique content. Don’t trouble
                yourself with having the last sentence in every paragraph serve as a mini-conclusion. Instead, worry
                about
                developing each point sufficiently and making your logical sequence clear. <h1>Conclusion: paragraphs as
                    punctuation</h1> To reiterate the initial point, it is useful to think of paragraphs as punctuation
                that
                organize your ideas in a readable way. Each paragraph should be an irreplaceable node within a coherent
                sequence of logic. Thinking of paragraphs as “building blocks” evokes the “five-paragraph theme”
                structure
                explained in <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/writing-in-college-from-competence-to-excellence/chapter/what-does-the-professor-want-understanding-the-assignment/">Chapter
                    2</a>: if you have identical stone blocks, it hardly matters what order they’re in. In the
                successful
                organically structured college paper, the structure and tone of each paragraph reflects its
                indispensable
                role within the overall piece. These goals—making every bit count and having each part situated within
                the
                whole—also anchor the discussion in the next chapter: how to write introductions and conclusions that
                frame—rather than simply book-end—your analysis. <div class="textbox examples">

                            the first century CE, ending as it did with the suicide of 960 Jewish rebels, has been
                            interpreted in various ways in Jewish history. History is best understood as a product of
                            the
                            present: the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of our complicated world. History

                                Shackleton</a> is often considered a model of effective leadership. <em>The

                            was frozen into the Antarctic ice where it was subsequently crushed, abandoning Shackleton
                            and
                            his 22-person crew on unstable ice floes, hundreds of miles from any human outpost. Two
                            harrowing journeys by lifeboat and several long marches over the ice over the course of two
                            Antarctic winters eventually resulted in their rescue. Amazingly, no one died during the
                            ordeal.C. A <em>recent analysis of a 1.8 million year-old hominid skull</em> suggests that
                            human
                            evolutionary lineage is simpler than we thought. <em>Homo erectus</em>, a species that
                            persisted
                            almost 2 million years, lived in most parts of Africa as well as Western and Eastern Asia.
                            Some
                            scientists are now arguing that <em>Homo erectus</em> individuals varied widely in their
                            body
                            size and skull shape, a claim strongly supported by the recently analyzed skull. Thus, some
                            other named species, such as <em>Homo habilis</em> and <em>Homo rudolfensis</em> are not
                            separate species but instead regional variations of <em>Homo erectus</em>.</li>

                <h1>In today’s world …</h1> Those opening words—so common in student papers—represent the most prevalent
                misconception about introductions: that they shouldn’t really say anything substantive. As noted in <a
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/writing-in-college-from-competence-to-excellence/chapter/what-does-the-professor-want-understanding-the-assignment/">Chapter
                    2</a>, the five-paragraph format that most students mastered before coming to college suggests that
                introductory paragraphs should start very general and gradually narrow down to the thesis. As a result,
                students frequently write introductions for college papers in which the first two or three (or more)
                sentences are patently obvious or overly broad. Charitable and well rested instructors just skim over
                that
                text and start reading closely when they arrive at something substantive. Frustrated and overtired
                instructors emit a dramatic self-pitying sigh, assuming that the whole paper will be as lifeless and
                gassy
                as those first few sentences. If you’ve gotten into the habit of beginning opening sentences with the
                following phrases, firmly resolve to strike them from your repertoire right now: <blockquote>
                    <div>In today’s world …</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Throughout human history …</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Since the dawn of time …</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Webster’s Dictionary defines [CONCEPT] as …</div>
                </blockquote> For one thing, sentences that begin with the first three stems are often wrong. For
                example,
                someone may write, “Since the dawn of time, people have tried to increase crop yields.” In reality,
                people
                have not been trying to increase crop yields throughout human history—<a target="_blank"

                    about 23,000 years old</a>, after all—and certainly not since the dawn of time (whenever that was).
                For
                another, sentences that start so broadly, even when factually correct, could not possibly end with
                anything
                interesting. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                        <p class="Student-Voices">I started laughing when I first read this chapter because my go-to
                            introduction for every paper was always “Throughout history...” In high school it was
                            true—my
                            first few sentences did not have any meaning. Now I understand it should be the exact
                            opposite.
                            Introductions should scream to your readers, HEY GUYS, READ THIS! I don’t want my readers’
                            eyes
                            to glaze over before they even finish the first paragraph, do you? And how annoying is it to
                            read a bunch of useless sentences anyways, right? Every sentence should be necessary and you
                            should set your papers with a good start.</p>

                </div> So what should you do? Well, start at the beginning. By that I mean, start explaining what the
                reader
                needs to know to comprehend your thesis and its importance. For example, compare the following two
                paragraphs: <h4>Five-Paragraph Theme Version:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Throughout time, human societies have had religion. Major world religions since the dawn of
                        civilization include Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Animism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These
                        and
                        all other religions provide a set of moral principles, a leadership structure, and an
                        explanation
                        for unknown questions such as what happens after people die. Since the dawn of religion, it has
                        always been opposed to science because one is based on faith and the other on reason. However,
                        the
                        notion of embodied cognition is a place where physical phenomena connect with religious ones.
                        Paradoxically, religion can emphasize a deep involvement in reality, an <em>embodied
                            cognition</em>
                        that empowers followers to escape from physical constraints and reach a new spirituality.
                        Religion
                        carefully constructs a physical environment to synthesize an individual’s memories, emotions,
                        and
                        physical actions, in a manner that channels the individual’s cognitive state towards spiritual
                        transcendence.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <h4>Organically Structured Version:<sup><a id="footnote-073-backlink" href="#footnote-073">1</a></sup>
                </h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Religion is an endeavor to cultivate freedom from bodily constraints to reach a higher state of
                        being beyond the physical constraints of reality. But how is it possible to employ a system, the
                        human body, to transcend its own limitations? Religion and science have always had an uneasy
                        relationship as empiricism is stretched to explain religious phenomena, but psychology has
                        recently
                        added a new perspective to the discussion. <em>Embodiment</em> describes the interaction between
                        humans and the environment that lays a foundation for cognition and can help explain the
                        mechanisms
                        that underlie religion’s influence on believers. This is a rare moment where science and
                        religion
                        are able to coexist without the familiar controversy. Paradoxically, religion can emphasize a
                        deep
                        involvement in reality, an <em>embodied cognition</em> that empowers followers to escape from
                        physical constraints and reach a new spirituality. Religion carefully constructs a physical
                        environment to synthesize an individual’s memories, emotions, and physical actions, in a manner
                        that
                        channels the individual’s cognitive state towards spiritual transcendence.</div>
                </blockquote> In the first version, the first three sentences state well known facts that do not
                directly
                relate to the thesis. The fourth sentence is where the action starts, though that sentence (“Since the
                dawn
                of religion, it has always been opposed to science because one is based on faith and the other on
                reason”)
                is still overstated: when was this dawn of religion? And was there “science,” as we now understand it,
                at
                that time? The reader has to slog through to the fifth sentence before the intro starts to develop some
                momentum. Training in the five-paragraph theme format seems to have convinced some student writers that
                beginning with substantive material will be too abrupt for the reader. But the second example shows that
                a
                meatier beginning isn’t jarring; it is actually much more engaging. The first sentence of the organic
                example is somewhat general, but it specifies the particular aspect of religion (transcending physical
                experience) that is germane to the thesis. The next six sentences lay out the ideas and concepts that
                explain the thesis, which is provided in the last two sentences. Overall, every sentence is needed to
                thoroughly frame the thesis. It is a lively paragraph in itself, and it piques the reader’s interest in
                the
                author’s original thinking about religion. Sometimes a vague introductory paragraph reflects a simple,
                obvious thesis (see <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/writing-in-college-from-competence-to-excellence/chapter/constructing-the-thesis-and-argument-from-the-ground-up/">Chapter
                    3</a>) and a poorly thought-out paper. More often, though, a shallow introduction represents a
                missed
                opportunity to convey the writer’s depth of thought from the get-go. Students adhering to the
                five-paragraph
                theme format sometime assume that such vagueness is needed to book-end an otherwise pithy paper. As you
                can
                see from these examples, that is simply untrue. I’ve seen some student writers begin with a vague,
                high-school style intro (thinking it obligatory) and then write a wonderfully vivid and engaging
                introduction as their second paragraph. Other papers I’ve seen have an interesting, original thesis
                embedded
                in late body paragraphs that should be articulated up front and used to shape the whole body. If you
                must
                write a vague “since the dawn of time” intro to get the writing process going, then go ahead. Just
                budget
                the time to rewrite the intro around your well developed, arguable thesis and ensure that the body
                paragraphs are organized explicitly by your analytical thread. Here are two more examples of excellent
                introductory paragraphs written by undergraduate students in different fields. Note how, in both cases,
                (1)
                the first sentence has real substance, (2) every sentence is indispensable to setting up the thesis, and
                (3)
                the thesis is complex and somewhat surprising. Both of these introductory paragraphs set an ambitious
                agenda
                for the paper. As a reader, it’s pretty easy to imagine how the body paragraphs that follow will
                progress
                through the nuanced analysis needed to carry out the thesis: From Davis O’Connell’s “Abelard”:<sup><a

                        with a
                        teenager, was castrated, and became a monk. All in a day’s work. Perhaps it’s no surprise that
                        Peter
                        Abelard gained the title of “heretic” along the way. A 12th-century philosopher and theologian,
                        Abelard tended to alienate nearly everyone he met with his extremely arrogant and egotistical
                        personality. This very flaw is what led him to start preaching to students that he had stolen
                        from
                        his former master, which further deteriorated his reputation. Yet despite all of the senseless
                        things that he did, his teachings did not differ much from Christian doctrine. Although the
                        church
                        claimed to have branded Abelard a heretic purely because of his religious views, the other
                        underlying reasons for these accusations involve his conceited personality, his relationship
                        with
                        the 14-year-old Heloise, and the political forces of the 12th century.</div>

                        multi-drug resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is of particular concern because of the
                        morbidity and mortality it causes, the limited treatment options it poses, and the difficulty in
                        implementing containment measures for its control. In order to appreciate the virulence of
                        <em>S.
                            aureus</em> and to help alleviate the problems its resistance is causing, it is important to
                        study the evolution of antibiotic resistance in this pathogen, the mechanisms of its resistance,
                        and
                        the factors that may limit or counteract its evolution. It is especially important to examine
                        how
                        human actions are causing evolutionary changes in this bacterial species. This review will

                        the historical sequence of causation that has led to antibiotic resistance in this microorganism

                        why natural selection favors the resistant trait. It is the goal of this review to illuminate

                        scope of the problem produced by antibiotic resistance in <em>S. aureus</em> and to illustrate

                the form so that you could later use it to deepen your thinking. By producing the five-paragraph theme
                over
                and over, it has probably become second nature for you to find a clear thesis and shape the intro
                paragraph
                around it, tasks you absolutely must accomplish in academic writing. However, you’ve probably been
                taught to
                proceed from “general” to “specific” in your intro and encouraged to think of “general” as “vague”. At
                the
                college level, think of “general” as context: begin by explaining the conceptual, historical, or factual
                context that the reader needs in order to grasp the significance of the argument to come. It’s not so
                much a
                structure of general-to-specific; instead it’s context-to-argument. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                <h1>In conclusion …</h1> I confess that I still find conclusions hard to write. By the time I’m
                finalizing a
                conclusion, I’m often fatigued with the project and struggling to find something new to say that isn’t a
                departure into a whole different realm. I also find that I have become so immersed in the subject that
                it
                seems like anything I have to say is absurdly obvious.<sup><a id="footnote-070-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-070">4</a></sup> A good conclusion is a real challenge, one that takes
                persistent
                work and some finesse. Strong conclusions do two things: they bring the argument to a satisfying close
                and
                they explain some of the most important implications. You’ve probably been taught to re-state your
                thesis
                using different words, and it is true that your reader will likely appreciate a brief summary of your
                overall argument: say, two or three sentences for papers less than 20 pages. It’s perfectly fine to use
                what
                they call “<a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.peabody.jhu.edu/conservatory/humanities/writing/metadiscourse.html">metadiscourse</a>”
                in this summary; metadiscourse is text like, “I have argued that …” or “This analysis reveals that … .”
                Go
                ahead and use language like that if it seems useful to signal that you’re restating the main points of
                your
                argument. In shorter papers you can usually simply reiterate the main point without that metadiscourse:
                for
                example, “What began as a protest about pollution turned into a movement for civil rights.” If that’s
                the
                crux of the argument, your reader will recognize a summary like that. Most of the student papers I see
                close
                the argument effectively in the concluding paragraph. The second task of a conclusion—situating the
                argument
                within broader implications—is a lot trickier. A lot of instructors describe it as the <a
                    target="_blank" href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/conclusions/"><em>“</em>So
                    what?<em>”</em></a> challenge.
                You’ve proven your point about the role of agriculture in deepening the Great Depression; so what? I
                don’t
                like the “so what” phrasing because putting writers on the defensive seems more likely to inhibit the
                flow
                of ideas than to draw them out. Instead, I suggest you imagine a friendly reader thinking, “OK, you’ve
                convinced me of your argument. I’m interested to know what you make of this conclusion. What is or
                should be
                different now that your thesis is proven?” In that sense, your reader is asking you to take your
                analysis
                one step further. That’s why a good conclusion is challenging to write. You’re not just coasting over
                the
                finish line. So, how do you do that? Recall from <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/writing-in-college-from-competence-to-excellence/chapter/constructing-the-thesis-and-argument-from-the-ground-up/">Chapter
                    3</a> that the third story of a three-story thesis situates an arguable claim within broader
                implications. If you’ve already articulated a thesis statement that does that, then you’ve already
                mapped
                the terrain of the conclusion. Your task then is to explain the implications you mentioned: if
                environmental
                justice really is the new civil rights movement, then how should scholars and/or activists approach it?
                If
                agricultural trends really did worsen the Great Depression, what does that mean for agricultural policy
                today? If your thesis, as written, is a two-story one, then you may want to revisit it after you’ve
                developed a conclusion you’re satisfied with and consider including the key implication in that thesis
                statement. Doing so will give your paper even more momentum. Let’s look at the concluding counterparts
                to
                the excellent introductions that we’ve read to illustrate some of the different ways writers can
                accomplish
                the two goals of a conclusion: Victor Seet on religious embodiment:<sup><a id="footnote-069-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-069">5</a></sup>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Embodiment is fundamental to bridging reality and spirituality. The concept demonstrates how
                        religious practice synthesizes human experience in reality—mind, body, and environment—to embed
                        a
                        cohesive religious experience that can recreate itself. Although religion is ostensibly focused
                        on
                        an intangible spiritual world, its traditions that eventually achieve spiritual advancement are
                        grounded in reality. The texts, symbols, and rituals integral to religious practice go beyond
                        merely
                        distinguishing one faith from another; they serve to fully absorb individuals in a culture that
                        sustains common experiential knowledge shared by millions. It is important to remember that
                        human
                        senses do not merely act as sponges absorbing external information; our mental models of the
                        world
                        are being constantly refined with new experiences. This fluid process allows individuals to
                        gradually accumulate a wealth of religious multimodal information, making the mental
                        representation
                        hyper-sensitive, which in turn contributes to religious experiences. However, there is an
                        important
                        caveat. Many features of religious visions that are attributed to embodiment can also be
                        explained
                        through less complex cognitive mechanisms. The repetition from religious traditions exercised
                        both
                        physically and mentally, naturally inculcates a greater religious awareness simply through
                        familiarity. Religious experiences are therefore not necessarily caused by embedded cues within
                        the
                        environment but arise from an imbued fluency with religious themes. Embodiment proposes a
                        connection
                        between body, mind, and the environment that attempts to explain how spiritual transcendence is
                        achieved through physical reality. Although embodied cognition assuages the conflict between
                        science
                        and religion, it remains to be seen if this intricate scientific theory is able to endure
                        throughout
                        millennia just as religious beliefs have.</div>
                </blockquote> The paragraph first re-caps the argument, then explains how embodiment relates to other
                aspects of religious experience, and finally situates the analysis within the broader relationship
                between
                religion and science. From Davis O’Connell:<sup><a id="footnote-068-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-068">6</a></sup>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Looking at Abelard through the modern historical lens, it appears to many historians that he
                        did
                        not fit the 12th-century definition of a heretic in the sense that his teachings did not differ
                        much
                        from that of the church. Mews observes that Abelard’s conception of the Trinity was a
                        continuation
                        of what earlier Christian leaders had already begun to ponder. He writes: “In identifying the
                        Son
                        and Holy Spirit with the wisdom and benignity of God, Abelard was simply extending an idea
                        (based on
                        Augustine) that had previously been raised by William of Champeaux.” St. Augustine was seen as
                        one
                        of the main Christian authorities during the Middle Ages and for Abelard to derive his teachings
                        from that source enhances his credibility. This would indicate that although Abelard was not
                        necessarily a heretic by the church’s official definition, he was branded as one through all of
                        the
                        nontheological social and political connotations that “heresy” had come to encompass.</div>
                </blockquote> O’Connell, interestingly, chooses a scholarly tone for the conclusion, in contrast to the
                more
                jocular tone we saw in the introduction. He doesn’t specifically re-cap the argument about Abelard’s
                deviance from social norms and political pressures, but rather he explains his summative point about
                what it
                means to be a heretic. In this case, the implications of the argument are all about Abelard. There
                aren’t
                any grand statements about religion and society, the craft of historiography, or the politics of
                language.
                Still, the reader is not left hanging. One doesn’t need to make far-reaching statements to successfully
                conclude a paper. From Logan Skelly:<sup><a id="footnote-067-backlink" href="#footnote-067">7</a></sup>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Considering the hundreds of millions of years that <em>S. aureus</em> has been evolving and
                        adapting to hostile environments, it is likely that the past seventy years of human antibiotic
                        usage
                        represents little more than a minor nuisance to these bacteria. Antibiotic resistance for
                        humans,
                        however, contributes to worldwide health, economic, and environmental problems. Multi-drug
                        resistant
                        <em>S. aureus</em> has proven itself to be a versatile and persistent pathogen that will likely
                        continue to evolve as long as selective pressures, such as antibiotics, are introduced into the
                        environment. While the problems associated with <em>S. aureus</em> have received ample attention
                        in
                        the scientific literature, there has been little resolution of the problems this pathogen poses.
                        If
                        these problems are to be resolved, it is essential that infection control measures and effective
                        treatment strategies be developed, adopted, and implemented in the future on a worldwide
                        scale—so
                        that the evolution of this pathogen’s virulence can be curtailed and its pathogenicity can be
                        controlled.</div>
                </blockquote> Skelly’s thesis is about the need to regulate antibiotic usage to mitigate antibiotic
                resistance. The concluding paragraph characterizes the pathogens evolutionary history (without
                re-capping
                the specifics) and then calls for an informed, well planned, and comprehensive response. All three
                conclusions above achieve both tasks—closing the argument and addressing the implications—but the
                authors
                have placed a different emphasis on the two tasks and framed the broader implications in different ways.
                Writing, like any craft, challenges the creator to make these kinds of independent choices. There isn’t
                a
                standard recipe for a good conclusion. <h1>Form and function</h1> As I’ve explained, some students
                mistakenly believe that they should avoid detail and substance in the introductions and conclusions of
                academic papers. Having practiced the five-paragraph form repeatedly, that belief sometimes gets built
                into
                the writing process; students sometimes just throw together those paragraphs thinking that they don’t
                really
                count as part of the analysis. Sometimes though, student writers know that more precise and vivid intros
                and
                outros are ideal but still settle on the vague language that seems familiar, safe, and do-able. Knowing
                the
                general form of academic writing (simplified in the five-paragraph theme) helps writers organize their
                thoughts; however, it leads some student writers to approach papers as mere fill-in-the-blank exercises.
                I
                hope you will instead envision paper-writing as a task of working through an unscripted and nuanced
                thought
                process and then sharing your work with readers. When you’re engaged with the writing process, you’ll
                find
                yourself deciding which substantive points belong in those introductory and concluding paragraphs rather
                than simply filling those paragraphs out with fluff. They should be sort of hard to write; they’re the
                parts
                of the paper that express your most important ideas in the most precise ways. If you’re struggling with
                intros and conclusions, it might be because you’re approaching them in exactly the right way. Having a
                clear, communicative purpose will help you figure out what your reader needs to know to really
                understand
                your thinking. <div class="textbox examples">

                <h1>Writing like you drive</h1> This and the following chapter discuss sentence-level composition, the
                kinds
                of things that many people associate with “writing.” Writing guides, especially those targeted at
                college
                students, offer excellent advice on sentence construction and word choice. However, <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.aims.edu/student/online-writing-lab/overview/myths">many student writers</a> get
                hung
                up on sentence-level expression, thinking that only elegant, erudite sentences will earn top grades. Or
                worse, some students assume that they’ll never produce strong papers if they do not already have some
                kind
                of inborn gift for wordsmithing. While it is true that some people can produce extraordinarily elegant
                and
                graceful prose, it is also true that anyone can learn to write effectively in ways that will persuade
                and
                satisfy readers. Producing and reading elegant writing is a pleasure, but what really matters in
                academic
                writing is precision. Focusing first or only on sentence-level issues is a troublesome approach. Doing
                so is
                like driving while looking only at the few feet of the road right in front of the bumper. <a
                    target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457510000357">Experienced drivers
                    instead
                    take in the larger scene and more effectively identify and avoid potential hazards with ongoing
                    course
                    corrections</a>. Writing well is like that. When you’ve put in the time and effort to take in the
                bigger
                picture of your analysis, most of the micro-scale moves happen automatically. That is, if you have a
                well-developed thesis and a carefully sequenced argument organized into cohesive and coherent
                paragraphs,
                many of the sentence-level issues take care of themselves. It’s easier to write effective sentences when
                their purpose is clear. You’ll still have to edit for clarity, concision, and mechanics, but if the
                thinking
                process behind the writing is well developed, editing shouldn’t be a huge chore. It can actually be a
                satisfying part of the process. One common metaphor notes that a good edit is like the last twist of a
                camera lens that brings the whole picture into focus. One approach that often leads to a difficult
                writing
                process and a clunky result is the pursuit of “<a target="_blank"
                    href="http://gradpost.ucsb.edu/tools/2011/1/2/beware-of-academese-and-write-like-you-speak.html">academese</a>”:
                an effort to write in an ornamented and “scholarly” way. As Michael Harvey explains<sup><a
                        id="footnote-091-backlink" href="#footnote-091">1</a></sup>, the desire to sound more academic
                might
                prompt a student to write “To satisfy her hunger for nutrition, she ate the bread” rather than simply
                “She
                was hungry, so she ate the bread.” It is true that a lot of academic writing is laden with unnecessary
                jargon, but the culture is shifting among scholars to favor plainer language and insist on clarity. Your
                professors are much more likely to find a self-consciously highbrow writing style tedious than
                impressive.
                As the saying goes<sup><a id="footnote-090-backlink" href="#footnote-090">2</a></sup>, any fool can make
                simple things complicated; it takes a genius to make complicated things simple. My hope with this
                chapter is
                to help you see those habits for yourself and, most importantly, how your readers experience them. If
                you’ve
                fallen prey to habits of academese, I hope this chapter helps you develop a more straightforward writing
                style, one well-suited to nuanced thinking and effective communication. And while I don’t want you to
                think
                of sentence-level wordsmithing as some kind of abstract, enchanted virtue, I do want you to understand
                that
                clarity and concision are more than aesthetics. Convoluted or wordy prose may contain some insightful or
                intriguing ideas, but if you can render those ideas in clear and concise prose, then you will inevitably
                develop those ideas even further in the course of writing. Unclear and bloated prose isn’t just tedious
                to
                your reader; it’s a needless obstacle to your own thinking. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                        <p class="Student-Voices">One of our professors’ primary reasons for assigning writing
                            assignments
                            is to evaluate how thoroughly we have digested the assigned reading material and lectures.
                            They
                            are not as interested in our ability to write Shakespearean prose as they are in our ability
                            to
                            absorb information, wrestle with it until we can comprehend it, and then convey that
                            understanding logically in writing. This is why writing assignments often start something
                            like,
                            “Drawing on Locke’s narrative …” or “Given what you’ve read about Darth Vader’s aversion to
                            democratic governance … .”</p>
                        <p class="Student-Voices">It is important to note that this process presupposes that we actually
                            read the assigned readings and take notes during class lectures and discussions.
                            Unsurprisingly,
                            the hardest writing assignments I have had in college were the ones for which I was least
                            prepared. I can try my darnedest to write beautifully, but if I have not put in the
                            necessary
                            time to actually read (and reread) the assigned material, I will have nothing meaningful to
                            say
                            and my professors will see straight through my bloviating.</p>
                        <p class="Student-Voices">That being said, the writing process is actually a highly effective
                            exercise for digesting material and developing a cohesive argument. Often it is not until I
                            start writing that I realize the holes in my thinking and the areas that I need to go back
                            and
                            study more thoroughly. This chapter provides many great practical pointers for editing our
                            papers in order to produce clear, refined arguments and should be returned to frequently.

                </div> The best way to achieve clarity and concision in writing is to <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/revising-drafts/">separate the drafting process from
                    the
                    revision process</a>. Highly effective writers routinely produce vague, tortuous, and bloated
                drafts,
                and are happy to do so. It usually means that they’re onto an interesting idea. Similarly, writers often
                write the same idea three or four different ways as they’re getting their thoughts down on paper. That’s
                fine. In fact, that’s better than fine because each repetition helps to develop key ideas and
                alternative
                approaches to the argument. A snarly first draft is often a great achievement. One just needs to take
                the
                time to develop relevant ideas and make them clear to the reader. For that reason, I write this section
                of
                the chapter envisioning someone who has already cranked out a very rough draft and is now in the process
                of
                revising for clarity and concision. <h1>Revising for clarity: who did what to whom?</h1> What makes a

                    6</a>, are a big help. Williams and Bizup offer another key point. They explain that readers
                experience
                writing as clear when the “character” of a sentence is also its grammatical subject and the key “action”
                a
                grammatical verb. They provide this fanciful example:<sup><a id="footnote-089-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-089">3</a></sup>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Once upon a time, as a walk through the woods was taking place on the part of Little Red Riding
                        Hood, the Wolf’s jump out from behind a tree caused her fright.</div>
                </blockquote> Grammatically, the subject of the first part is “a walk through the woods,” and the verb
                is
                “taking place”. The character, though, is obviously Little Red Riding Hood and the action is walking. A
                much
                more straightforward version—“As Little Red Riding Hood walked through the woods”—makes the character
                the
                subject and the action the key verb. That example goes out of its way to be silly, but consider this
                example
                from a website offering free college papers:<sup><a id="footnote-088-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-088">4</a></sup>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Another event that connects the colonist and the English together is the event of a hated King
                        in
                        England trying to take away freedom and go back to the old ways. The idea of how much power the
                        King
                        had struck Parliament. After that, the Parliament and the people made the King sign the Magna
                        Carta,
                        which limits the amount of power the King has. The Magna Carta also affected the rights of the
                        American colonies. It practically took away all relationships between the King and the colonies.
                        After the relationship was broken, America broke off from England.</div>
                </blockquote> Apparently, the author is claiming that the colonists (in the 1700s?) pushed back against
                the
                power of the English crown in a manner similar to the Parliamentarians in 1215 (after having apparently
                been
                “struck” by an “idea” of “how much power the King had”). Grammatically, the subjects are an “event” and
                an
                “idea” rather than the characters, colonists, the king, and Parliament. The third sentence is
                refreshingly
                straightforward in structure (though vague on details). The fifth and sixth sentences are fairly
                straightforward, but also incredibly vague: the Magna Carta predated the American colonies by at least
                400
                years<sup><a id="footnote-087-backlink" href="#footnote-087">5</a></sup>; how does that document relate

                the American Revolution? The last sentence essentially says that after the relationship was broken, the
                relationship was broken. If the author were to rewrite the passage to make the grammatical subjects
                match
                the characters, he or she would be prompted to clarify what exactly the king, the Parliament, the
                English
                populace, and the American colonists did (and to who), something which the author of the above passage
                may
                not actually understand. This example illustrates how clarifying “who did what to whom” for the reader
                also
                makes writers clarify it for themselves. Writing clearly involves thinking clearly, and clear rigorous
                thinking is why your professors assign you writing in the first place. While the Magna Carta example is
                comically bad, here’s one that is more or less logical but would still benefit from greater clarity:
                <blockquote>
                    <div>IgE-dependent allergic hypersensitivity reactions such as allergic asthma and food allergy
                        involve
                        mast cells which are typically regarded as troublesome cells as a result. Further, the allergic
                        sensitization-processes also involves a role for mast cells. Recent findings show that their
                        functionality is not only pro-inflammatory, but can on the contrary have suppressive or
                        immunomodulatory effects in allergic inflammation.</div>
                </blockquote> The above passage isn’t a terrible slog, and it’s fairly clear that the whole passage is
                about
                mast cells. But here’s a version of the same passage—the real version as it were—which demonstrates that
                the
                passage <em>feels</em> a lot clearer when mast cells, the “characters” driving the narrative, are also
                the
                grammatical subject of the sentence and the referent for the key verbs:<sup><a
                        id="footnote-086-backlink" href="#footnote-086">6</a></sup>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Mast cells are typically regarded as troublesome cells due to their prominent role in
                        IgE-dependent
                        allergic hypersensitivity reactions such as allergic asthma and food allergy. Further, it seems
                        that
                        mast cells are also able to play an additional role in the allergic sensitization-processes.
                        Recent
                        findings show that mast cell functionality is not only pro-inflammatory, but can on the contrary
                        have suppressive or immunomodulatory effects in allergic inflammation.</div>
                </blockquote> Both versions of the passage are consistently about mast cells, but the second version
                makes
                that consistency much more obvious to readers as mast cells are the main character of every sentence.
                That
                clear consistency allows us to devote more of our brain power to recalling technical terms (like
                immunomodulatory) and comprehending the key ideas. That makes it both easier and more interesting to
                read.
                To further illustrate the principle, let’s take a nicely straightforward passage and rewrite it so that
                the
                characters are objects (rather than subjects) and the actions are nouns<sup><a
                        id="footnote-085-backlink" href="#footnote-085">7</a></sup> (rather than verbs). Here’s the
                nicely clear original:<sup><a id="footnote-084-backlink" href="#footnote-084">8</a></sup>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>What most people really feel nostalgic about has little to do with the internal structure of
                        1950s
                        families. It is the belief that the 1950s provided a more family-friendly economic and social
                        environment, an easier climate in which to keep kids on the straight and narrow, and above all,
                        a
                        greater feeling of hope for a family’s long-term future, especially for its young.</div>
                </blockquote> In these two sentences, the character is a belief rather than a person or thing. However,
                the
                passage is still clear to the reader because it keeps the character consistent and explains what that
                character does (creates nostalgia) to who (people at large). Imagine if the author wrote this instead:
                <blockquote>
                    <div>People feel nostalgic not about the internal structure of 1950s families. Rather, the beliefs
                        about
                        how the 1950s provided a more family-friendly economic and social environment, an easier climate
                        in
                        which to keep kids on the straight and narrow, and above all, a greater feeling of hope for a
                        family’s long-term future (especially for its young) are what lead to those nostalgic feelings.
                    </div>
                </blockquote> This second version says substantially the same thing, but it’s tedious to read because
                the
                character changes abruptly from “people” to “beliefs” (which works against cohesion) and one has to get
                to
                the end of the sentence to learn how these beliefs fit in. The key point is this: one of the best things
                you
                can do to revise for greater clarity is to recast a passage so that the characters are the grammatical
                subjects and the key actions are the verbs. <h1>Concision and grace</h1> <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/writing-in-college-from-competence-to-excellence/chapter/intros-and-outros/">Chapter
                    7</a> on introductions and conclusions notes the importance of concision, as those framing parts of
                the
                paper are often the most egregiously bloated. The general rule introduced there holds for any writing:
                every
                word and sentence should be doing some significant work for the paper as a whole. Sometimes that work is
                more to provide pleasure than meaning—you needn’t ruthlessly eliminate every rhetorical flourish—but
                everything in the final version should add something unique to the paper. As with clarity, the benefits
                of
                concision are intellectual as well as stylistic: revising for concision forces writers to make
                deliberate
                decisions about the claims they want to make and their reasons for making them. Michael Harvey<sup><a
                        id="footnote-083-backlink" href="#footnote-083">9</a></sup> notes that fluffy, wordy prose does
                not
                necessarily result from an underdeveloped writing process. Sometimes it reflects the context of academic
                writing: <blockquote>
                    <div>[M]any of us are afraid of writing concisely because doing so can make us feel exposed.
                        Concision
                        leaves us fewer words to hide behind. Our insights and ideas might appear puny stripped of those
                        inessential words, phrases, and sentences in which we rough them out. We might even wonder, were
                        we
                        to cut out the fat, would anything be left? It’s no wonder, then, that many students make little
                        attempt to be concise—[and] may, in fact, go out of their way not to be … .</div>
                </blockquote> As noted in the opening example of <a target="_blank"

                    4</a>, effortful thinking is something most people naturally try to avoid most of the time. It’s
                both
                arduous and anxiety provoking to go beyond existing knowledge and assumptions to venture into unknown
                territory. In some ways, too, the general structure of education conditions students to approach papers
                as
                blanks to be filled rather than open-ended problems to explore. When students actively avoid concision,
                it’s
                often because they want to avoid the hard thinking concision requires, they assume that writing is all
                about
                expressing opinions rather than undertaking a rigorous thought process, or they fear that they can’t
                adequately perform and communicate an ambitious analysis. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                    satisfying concision</a>.<sup><a id="footnote-082-backlink" href="#footnote-082">10</a></sup> Most
                of
                the advice boils down to three key moves: <ol>
                    <li>Look for words and phrases that you can cut entirely. Look for bits that are redundant: (“each
                        <em>and every,</em>” “<em>unexpected</em> surprise,” “predictions <em>about the future</em>”),
                        meaningless (“<em>very</em> unique,” “<em>certain</em> factors,” “<em>slightly</em>
                        terrifying”), or
                        clichéd (“as far as the eye can see,” or “long march of time”).</li>
                    <li>Look for opportunities to replace longer phrases with shorter phrases or words. For example,
                        “the
                        way in which” can often be replaced by “how” and “despite the fact that” can usually be replaced
                        by
                        “although.” Strong, precise verbs can often replace bloated phrases. Consider this example: “The
                        goal of Alexander the Great was to create a united empire across a vast distance.” And compare
                        it to
                        this: “Alexander the Great sought to unite a vast empire.”</li>
                    <li>Try to rearrange sentences or passages to make them shorter and livelier. Williams and
                        Bizup<sup><a id="footnote-081-backlink" href="#footnote-081">11</a></sup> recommend changing
                        negatives to
                        affirmatives. Consider the negatives in this sentence: “School nurses often do not notice if a
                        young
                        schoolchild does not have adequate food at home.” You could more concisely and clearly write,
                        “School nurses rarely notice if a young schoolchild lacks adequate food at home.” It says the
                        same
                        thing, but is much easier to read which makes for a happier and more engaged reader.</li>
                </ol> Good parallelism can also help you write shorter text that better conveys your thinking. For
                example,
                Stacy Schiff writes this in her best-selling biography of Cleopatra<sup><a id="footnote-080-backlink"
                        href="#footnote-080">12</a></sup>: <blockquote>
                    <div>A goddess as a child, a queen at eighteen, a celebrity soon thereafter, she was an object of
                        speculation and veneration, gossip and legend, even in her own time.</div>
                </blockquote> Imagine if, instead, Schiff wrote this: <blockquote>
                    <div>Cleopatra was seen as divine when she was a child. She became the sovereign ruler at eighteen,
                        and
                        she became well known throughout the ancient world early in her reign. People speculated about
                        her,
                        worshipped her, gossiped about her, and told legends about her, even in her own time.</div>
                </blockquote> The second version says the same thing, but the extra words tend to obscure Schiff’s
                point.
                The original (“<em>goddess</em> as a child, <em>queen</em> at eighteen, <em>celebrity</em> soon
                thereafter”)
                effectively uses parallelism to vividly convey the dramatic shifts in Cleopatra’s roles and her
                prominence
                in the ancient world. <h1>Reading with concision and grace in mind</h1> There is less tolerance for
                academese than there used to be in scholarly communities; however, a lot of landmark texts were written
                in a
                time when there wasn’t such a high value placed on clarity and concision. In your studies, then, you
                will
                probably have to engage with important texts that violate almost all the advice given here. Consider the
                following example from <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.asanet.org/about/presidents/Talcott_Parsons.cfm">Talcott Parsons</a>, a
                sociological
                theorist noted for both his intellectual force and utterly impenetrable writing style. In reading this
                passage, <sup><a id="footnote-079-backlink" href="#footnote-079">13</a></sup> imagine “ego” and “alter”
                as
                two people interacting: <blockquote>
                    <div>Communication through a common system of symbols is the precondition of this reciprocity or
                        complementarity of expectations. The alternatives which are open to alter must have some measure
                        of
                        stability in two respects: first, as realistic possibilities for alter, and second, in their
                        meaning
                        to ego. This stability presupposes generalization from the particularity of the given situations
                        of
                        ego and alter, both of which are continually changing and are never concretely identical over
                        any
                        two moments in time. When such generalization occurs, and actions, gestures, or symbols have
                        more or
                        less the same meaning for both ego and alter, we may speak of a common culture existing between
                        them, through which their interaction is mediated.</div>
                </blockquote> Here’s a version after I edited for concision using the three moves described above:
                <blockquote>
                    <div>Reciprocity, or complementary expectations, depends on a common system of symbols. The symbolic
                        alternatives for alter must be stable, in that they are both realistic for alter and meaningful
                        to
                        ego. That is, actions, gestures, or symbols must have a shared and persistent meaning for ego
                        and
                        alter even though ego and alter are in different situations and are constantly changing. When
                        meanings are shared and persistent, we may say that the interaction between alter and ego is
                        mediated by a common culture.</div>
                </blockquote> The revised version is about 30 percent shorter, and it demonstrates how concision makes
                one’s
                points come through more clearly. You will almost certainly have to read works of authors who did not
                prioritize clarity and concision (or even cohesion and coherence), and that’s a drag. But knowing how
                wordiness interferes with clarity can help you distill essential meanings from challenging texts. In
                many
                ways, writing well and reading incisively are two facets of the same cognitive skill set. <h1>Grace</h1>
                Academic writing is not wholly utilitarian. An elegant and apt turn of phrase is satisfying both to
                write
                and to read. While you can’t often summon elegance out of nowhere, you can learn a few structures that
                are
                often pleasing to the reader’s ear because they harmonize <em>what</em> you’re saying with <em>how</em>
                you’re saying it.<sup><a id="footnote-078-backlink" href="#footnote-078">14</a></sup> Here are two <a

                that
                you can use to reinforce your points. <ol>
                    <li>Balance. Readers often find balanced sentences and phrases pleasing. The Cleopatra example above
                        (“<em>goddess</em> as a child, <em>queen</em> at eighteen, <em>celebrity</em> soon thereafter”)
                        illustrates parallelism, which is one kind of balance: using parallel structures to convey a
                        parallel idea. This parallelism not only helps Schiff be powerfully concise, it quickly and
                        vividly
                        conveys the idea that Cleopatra led a remarkable life. Williams and Bizup<sup><a
                                id="footnote-077-backlink" href="#footnote-077">15</a></sup> offer another example of an
                        elegant sentence in which the two parts are balanced in their structure: <blockquote>
                            <div>A government that is unwilling to listen to the moderate hopes of its citizenry must

                                <em>citizenry</em> must eventually answer to the <em>harsh justice</em> of its

                        </blockquote> The balanced structure and contrasting language reinforces the author’s either-or
                        point: “listen” <em>or</em> “answer”; “moderate hopes” <em>or</em> “harsh justice”, “citizenry”
                        <em>or</em> “revolutionaries.” The balanced structure adds rhetorical force to the argument.

                            <div>But far and away, the largest weight-inducing food, out-stripping all others, was the
                                potato chip.<sup><a id="footnote-076-backlink" href="#footnote-076">16</a></sup></div>
                        </blockquote> Version 2: <blockquote>
                            <div>But far and away, the potato chip was the largest weight-inducing food, out-stripping
                                all
                                others.</div>
                        </blockquote>
                    </li>
                </ol> The first version places a particular rhetorical emphasis on “the potato chip” because it comes
                last
                in the sentence after a three-part build-up. The second version says the exact same thing, and it isn’t
                hard
                to see that “potato chip” is the key part of the sentence. However, the rhetorical emphasis on “the
                potato
                chip” is somewhat weaker. This common rhetorical trick is to put the part you want to emphasize at the
                very
                end of the sentence. These are just two rhetorical structures that scholars have identified. You can
                find
                others (Google “rhetorical device”) that you can bring into your repertoire. Most people can’t set out
                to
                write elegantly per se, and you certainly shouldn’t spend your writing time crafting elegantly balanced
                sentences that have little to do with your argument or analysis. But the more familiar you are with
                these
                rhetorical structures, the more often you can recognize and use them. <div class="textbox examples">

                            attractive. The implicit pressure to shape the language of the findings to avoid alienation
                            between scholars and companies is worrisome to consider.B. While educational experiences are

                            need to keep the role of the models in perspective. When scientific interest centers on the
                            large-scale effects, the idea is to use a few extra small-scale parameters so that the

                <h1>“Correctness” in writing</h1> Many students assume—or fear—that college writing is judged primarily
                on
                its grammatical correctness. Ideas, evidence, and arguments matter more than the mechanics of grammar
                and
                punctuation; however, many of the rules of formal writing exist to promote clarity and precision which
                writers much achieve in order to effectively convey ideas, evidence, and arguments. In addition, texts
                that
                observe the rules of formal written English tend to be more persuasive by making the author appear well
                informed and careful. <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/07/i-wont-hire-people-who-use-poo/">Writing replete with errors does
                    not
                    make a great impression</a>, and most educators want to help students present themselves well.
                Correctness, then, isn’t <em>the</em> most important thing, but it does matter. Another common
                assumption
                among students is that one is either good at grammar or not good at grammar, and that such is one’s
                immutable fate. Not true. Once you master a particular rule or practice, it becomes second nature, and
                then
                you can focus your attention on mastering another. I finally nailed down commas and semicolons in
                college
                and some finer points of grammar in graduate school. I do a lot of formal writing in the course of my
                career, and I still look things up in a <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://pages.mail.bfwpub.com/hackerhandbooks">writing handbook</a> from time to time. You can
                master the practices of formal written English, and college is a great time to use the feedback from
                your
                professors to identify your common errors and learn to correct them. In thinking about correctness, it’s
                important to recognize that some rules are more important than others. Joseph Williams helpfully
                distinguishes three kinds of rules.<sup><a id="footnote-097-backlink" href="#footnote-097">1</a></sup>
                First, there are rules that are basic to English, such as “the car” not “car the.” For example,
                <blockquote>
                    <div>INCORRECT: I thought whether true claims not.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: I hadn’t thought about whether the claims were true.</div>
                </blockquote> If you’ve gotten most of your formal education in English, you probably observe these
                rules
                routinely. If your writing has mismatches of number (singular/plural) or tense, it might be due to haste
                or
                carelessness rather than unawareness. Similarly, capitalizing the first word of a sentence and ending
                with
                appropriate punctuation are basic rules that most people comply with automatically when writing for a
                professor or in other formal situations. Williams’ second category is comprised of rules that
                distinguish
                standard written English from the informal variants that people use in their day-to-day lives. Most
                students
                with middle-class and non-immigrant backgrounds use informal vernaculars that closely parallel standard
                written English. Students with working-class or more modest backgrounds or who are members of
                transnational
                and multi-lingual communities may use informal variants of English in their everyday lives that are
                quite
                different from standard written English. It’s an unfortunate reality of social inequality that such
                students
                have to expend more effort than their middle-class English-speaking counterparts to master the standard
                conventions. It’s not really fair, but at least the mechanics and rules of formal writing are documented
                and
                unambiguous. Learning to communicate effectively in different social contexts is part of becoming an
                educated person. Some examples: <blockquote>
                    <div>INFORMAL:We ain’t got no more of them cookies.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>FORMAL: We don’t have any more of those cookies.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>INFORMAL: My coat, my phone, and my keys was all lock in the car.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>FORMAL: My coat, my phone, and my keys were all locked in the car.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>INFORMAL: u shd go 2 café b4 wrk bc coffee</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>FORMAL: You should go the café before work to get some coffee.</div>
                </blockquote> The informal versions are clearly English, and they’re widely understandable to others.
                The
                first and second examples contain choices of tense, number, and punctuation that are <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://iume.tc.columbia.edu/i/a/document/15343_Digest_32.pdf">inappropriate in standard
                    written
                    English even though they don’t actually impede communication</a>. Most students already understand
                that
                these first two categories of rules (rules fundamental to English and the rules of standard written
                English)
                are obligatory for formal writing. There is a third category of rules that Williams notes and
                enthusiastically criticizes; he calls them “invented rules” because they usually arise from busybody
                grammarians rather than enduring patterns of customary language use. Some invented rules Williams calls
                “options”: those that your reader will notice when you <em>observe</em> them and not care if you don’t.
                Here’s an example of the fabled <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/11/grammar-myths-prepositions/">don’t-end-a-sentence-with-a-preposition
                    rule</a>: <blockquote>
                    <div>OBSERVING THE RULE: With which concept can we analyze this problem?</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>IGNORING THE RULE: Which concept can we analyze this problem with?</div>
                </blockquote> Some grammarians would claim that only the first version is correct. However, you probably
                have the (accurate) impression that professional writers are much more likely to choose the second
                version.
                This rule does not reflect real-life customary practice, even in standard written English. That’s why
                Williams calls it an “invented rule.” Most of your professors are fine with the second version above,
                the
                one that ends a sentence with a preposition. Similarly, there’s this <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/split-infinitives">murky idea out there that one
                    should
                    not split infinitives</a>; that is, one should not have any words between “to” and the verb that
                follows. Here’s an example: <blockquote>
                    <div>OBSERVED: to go boldly where no one has gone before</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>IGNORED: to boldly go where no one has gone before</div>
                </blockquote> Again, while some grammarians have argued that conscientious writers should avoid
                splitting
                infinitives, most professional writers have ignored that claim. The second version, which puts the
                adverb
                (“boldly”) within the infinitive (that is, between “to” and “go”) makes for a perfectly clear and
                pleasing
                phrase. The invented rule about splitting infinitives is an attempt to solve a problem that doesn’t
                exist.
                If you want to give your writing more of a scholarly air, you could observe some or all of these
                optional
                rules. But, unless your professor has a particular penchant for one of these invented rules, you can
                safely
                ignore them. Williams calls the second sub-category of invented rules “folklore.” They’re invented rules
                (like “options”) in that grammarians think writers should observe them, but, in reality, no one does.
                Williams gleefully lists instances in which the very grammarians who propose these rules go on to
                unselfconsciously violate them.<sup><a id="footnote-096-backlink" href="#footnote-096">2</a></sup> You
                may
                have heard of these rules, but they’re widely considered absurd. For example, some grammarians are
                dismayed
                that people use “that” and “which” interchangeably, and they argue that writers should use “that” to
                indicate restrictive elements and “which” to indicate non-restrictive elements. A restrictive element is
                one
                that makes a necessary specification about something; a non-restrictive element is one that simple adds
                extra information. Consider these two examples: <h4>Version 1:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>The party that Alex went to was shut down by the police.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <h4>Version 2:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>The party which Alex went to was shut down by the police.</div>
                </blockquote> For almost all readers, versions 1 and 2 are saying the exact same thing. For the
                persnickety
                grammarian, version 1 is specifying the party that <em>Alex</em> went to, and not the party that, say,
                Jordan went to, while version 2 is simply inserting extra information about Alex’s attendance at the
                party.
                According to these grammarians, “that Alex went to” adds critically needed information (restrictive)
                while
                “which Alex went to” adds bonus information (non-restrictive). As Williams and some others explain: <a
                    target="_blank" href="http://stancarey.wordpress.com/2011/10/18/that-which-is-restrictive/">it’s
                    bullshit</a>. Professional writers use commas and carefully chosen words to do the job of
                distinguishing
                restrictive and non-restrictive elements, and they choose whichever relative pronoun (“that” or “which”)
                sounds better in context. You could observe the distinction between that and which if you like, but no
                one
                would notice. More importantly, observing this invented rule wouldn’t necessarily make your writing any
                clearer, more concise, or more graceful. There is one rule that Williams calls “folklore” that you
                probably
                have to observe in college papers nonetheless: that is, the rule that <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/01/can-i-start-a-sentence-with-a-conjunction/">you
                    can’t
                    start sentences with But, And, So, For, or Yet (or other coordinating conjunctions)</a>. I’m sure
                you
                could browse through assigned readings and articles published in major newspapers and magazines that
                violate
                this so-called rule. Here are two examples that took me about 10 minutes to find: <blockquote>

                </blockquote> If you’re writing a paper for my class, feel free to begin sentences with conjunctions. As
                the
                above examples show, it’s a concise way to support clarity and effective flow. However, I suspect most
                instructors still hold to the old rule. Thus, you shouldn’t start sentences with “And,” “But” or other
                coordinating conjunctions unless you’ve been specifically invited to. There are countless other rules
                that I
                don’t discuss here. The point of these examples is to show that you don’t have to observe every little
                rule
                you’ve ever heard of. There are some elements of mechanics that you have to master; I summarize some
                common
                ones below. These practices will gradually become second nature. It’s sometimes hard to know at the
                outset
                which rules are standard, which are options, and which are folklore. With the help of a good handbook
                and
                your instructors, you’ll learn them over time. The larger point I want to make here is that that
                observing
                rules isn’t about traversing a minefield of potential errors; it’s just about learning and adopting the
                practices appropriate to your audience, which is one of the first rules of writing well. <h1>Elements of
                    punctuation and language you must master</h1> If you’ve gotten most or all of your formal education
                in
                English, you’ve mastered the vast majority of the real rules of grammar. Most of the students I work
                with
                just have to nail down a few additional practices to produce appropriate academic writing. There isn’t
                any
                great secret to learning them; they’re learned through repeated practice and feedback. <h2>1. Comma
                    usage
                </h2> I didn’t really master correct comma usage until my college years. There was a year or so in which
                I
                constantly checked my work against a style guide, but since then I haven’t often had to think about
                commas.
                Here’s a brief run-down of the rules of comma usage that I see many students violating. For a more
                complete
                explanation, and an invaluable set of online exercises, see <a target="_blank"

                    Diana
                    Hacker</a>. <h4>A. Use a comma to join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction:</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: Her misdeed was significant, but the punishment was excessive.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>ALSO CORRECT: Her misdeed was significant but justified by the circumstances.</div>
                </blockquote> In the first example, the comma is telling the reader that one clause (her misdeed was
                significant) is ending and another (the punishment was excessive) beginning. The second example does not
                use
                a comma, because the words that follow “but” (justified by the circumstances) do not add up to an
                independent clause; they make a dependent clause that could not stand alone as a sentence. Note:
                “Because”
                is NOT a coordinating conjunction. It’s a subordinating conjunction. Therefore, it does not use a comma:
                <blockquote>
                    <div>INCORRECT: Conspiracy theories can be compelling, because many people distrust the government.
                    </div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: Conspiracy theories can be compelling because many people distrust the government.
                    </div>
                </blockquote> “Because,” like other subordinating conjunctions (such as “although,” “unless,” or
                “until”),
                is meant to knit together one indivisible thought; hence, no comma. Including a comma weakens the
                connection
                in the mind of your reader. <h4>B. Use a comma to mark the end of an introductory element</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: While we were eating, the baby crawled out of the room.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: Alongside the road, we found the perpetrator’s gun.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: Because many distrust the government, conspiracy theories can be compelling.</div>
                </blockquote> The first example would be comically confusing without the comma. The second example shows
                how
                the comma helps your reader separate the introductory element from the part that followed. The third
                example
                might be confusing. The sentence from part A, above, beginning with “Conspiracy theories” does not use a
                comma, but in this example, a dependent clause is serving as as an introductory element. <div

                            college,
                            writing stops being about “how well did you understand fill-in-the-blank” and becomes “how
                            professionally and strongly do you argue your point.” Professionalism, I have found, is the
                            key
                            to the real world, and college is, in part, preparing you for it. If you do not learn how to
                            write in a way that projects professionalism (i.e. these rules), then expect to get, at

                </div>
                <h4>C. Use a comma to set off non-essential information (so-called non-restrictive elements)</h4> Both
                of
                these sentences are correct, but they convey different ideas: <blockquote>
                    <div>EXAMPLE 1: Gathering places vital to their communities are worth the investment.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>EXAMPLE 2: Gathering places, vital to their communities, are worth the investment.</div>
                </blockquote> The first says that <em>only</em> those gathering places that are vital to their
                communities
                are worth the investment (implying that some are not vital and therefore not worth investing in). In
                that
                first example, “vital to their communities” is a restrictive element. In the second example “vital to
                their
                communities” is extra information. The sentence implies that gathering places <em>in general</em> are
                worth
                the investment (ostensibly because they’re vital to their communities). The commas mark the phrase as
                non-essential information, which is a non-restrictive element. In writing the second sentence, you might
                enclose the non-essential information in parentheses instead. <h2>2. Use punctuation and coordinating
                    conjunctions to avoid sentence fragments</h2> At some point, you were probably instructed that all
                sentences must have a subject (which includes a noun) and a predicate (which includes a verb) and that
                they
                must be written to stand alone. Consider this example of <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/620/1/">a sentence fragment</a>: <blockquote>
                    <div>INCORRECT: When you go to the supermarket. You don’t often think about the work behind the
                        scenes.
                    </div>
                </blockquote> It has a subject (you) and predicate (go to the supermarket), but the “when” indicates
                that
                the sentence is incomplete. When people write sentence fragments, they usually have the missing elements
                in
                the preceding or following sentences, so it’s really a punctuation error. <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: When you go to the supermarket, you don’t often think about the work behind the
                        scenes.
                    </div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>ALSO CORRECT: You don’t often think about the work behind the scenes when you go to the
                        supermarket.</div>
                </blockquote> In the first version the dependent clause (the part that couldn’t stand alone) comes
                first,
                necessitating a comma. In the second, the main clause (the part that could stand alone) comes first, so
                no
                comma is used. <h2>3. Use punctuation and coordinating conjunctions to avoid <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/598/02/">run-on sentences and comma
                        splices</a>
                </h2> A run-on sentence (one that smooshes two sentences together) may be incorrectly connected with a
                comma, which is then called a comma splice. This error is easily corrected with punctuation and some
                coordinating words. <blockquote>
                    <div>INCORRECT (run-on): The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest literary works it had a major
                        influence on Mesopotamian culture.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>INCORRECT (comma splice): The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest literary works, it had a
                        major influence on Mesopotamian culture.</div>
                </blockquote> Clearly, the writer wants the reader to see these two sentences as connected. He or she
                has
                three options to show their reader how the sentences relate. <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT OPTION 1 (semi-colon): The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest literary works; it
                        had
                        a major influence on Mesopotamian culture.</div>
                </blockquote> The semi-colon is an elegant and underutilized option. By joining two sentences with a
                semi-colon, the writer can subtly tell the reader that the epic’s earliness and influence, together,
                make it
                important. <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT OPTION 2 (comma and coordinating conjunction): The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the
                        earliest
                        literary works, and it had a major influence on Mesopotamian culture.</div>
                </blockquote> The use of “and” in this option also tells the reader to put the two claims together. A
                more
                specific conjunction—such as “but,” “so”, or “yet”—is usually a better choice than “and” or a semi-colon
                because it would provide more information about how the two claims relate. <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT OPTION 3 (separate sentences): The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest literary
                        works.
                        It had a major influence on Mesopotamian culture.</div>
                </blockquote> If you don’t want your reader to consider the two sentences closely related, you can
                convey
                that by choosing separate sentences. With the Gilgamesh example, you might choose this option if the
                paragraph is mostly about the influence of the epic on Mesopotamian culture but you have a good reason
                to
                include a sentence about how early it is. These two sentences would function well as the first two
                sentences
                of an introductory paragraph. <h2>4. Use colons correctly for lists, quotations, and explanatory
                    information
                </h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>INCORRECT: We packed: clothes, camping equipment, and a first-aid kit.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: We packed the essentials: clothes, camping equipment, and a first-aid kit.</div>
                </blockquote> For lists, use a colon when the part before the colon can stand alone as a sentence.
                Otherwise, leave the colon out (“We packed clothes, camping equipment, and a first-aid kit”).
                <blockquote>
                    <div>INCORRECT: Mitchell explains that: “Part of the fascination of <em>Gilgamesh</em> is that, like
                        any
                        great work of literature, it has much to tell us about ourselves.”<sup><a

                </blockquote> You can use a colon to introduce a quote if the parts before and after the colon can stand
                as
                complete sentences. A comma is an option here as well. Introducing a quote with your own complete
                sentence
                and a colon is another underutilized trick in student writing. Recall from <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/writing-in-college-from-competence-to-excellence/chapter/listening-to-sources-talking-to-sources/">Chapter
                    5</a> that you have to use source material within your own analytical thread. Introducing a quote
                with
                your own complete sentence can make it immediately clear why the quote you choose is important to your
                argument. <h2>5. Use modifiers clearly and precisely</h2> Modifiers are words and phrases that add
                information to a sentence. They specify the meaning of (that is, they modify) a noun or verb. Sometimes
                the
                modifier is misplaced, ambiguous, or not clearly pertaining to a noun or verb (a so-called dangling
                modifier). These problems can lead the reader to wonder what exactly you’re claiming. <blockquote>
                    <div>MISPLACED: The ski-jumper looked sleek in his new suit weighing only 140 pounds.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: The ski-jumper looked sleek wearing a new suit and weighing only 140 pounds.</div>
                </blockquote> The suit didn’t weigh 140 pounds (one hopes); the ski-jumper did. <blockquote>
                    <div>AMBIGUOUS: When formal rules and day-to-day practices differ, they should be changed.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CLEAR: Formal rules should be changed to match day-to-day practices.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CLEAR: Day-to-day practices should be changed to match the formal rules.</div>
                </blockquote> In the first version, it’s not clear what should be changed. The two clear versions make
                it
                obvious what the author is arguing. <blockquote>
                    <div>DANGLING: Walking down the street, the houses glowed pink in the sunset.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: Walking down the street, she saw houses glowing pink in the sunset.</div>
                </blockquote> The first version suggests that the houses were walking down the street. The pronoun to
                which
                that first phrase refers (“she”) is missing. The second version corrects that by bringing in the needed
                pronoun. <h2>6. Choose correct words</h2> <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://wsuonline.weber.edu/wrh/words.htm">Many wrong-word errors</a> that I see seem to be
                artifacts of the spell-checkers built into word-processing programs. For example, I often see
                “costumers”
                where students meant “customers,” “defiantly” instead of “definitely” and, somewhat comically, “martial”
                instead of “marital.” Other wrong-word errors come from homonyms, two or more words that sound the same,
                such as the there/their/they’re or your/you’re errors. In college writing, another common one is the
                misuse
                of effect/affect. Use “effect” if you’re talking about the result of a cause as a noun, and “affect” if
                you
                mean influence or talking about emotion in psychology (in which case it’s pronounced AF-fect).
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: The effects of the conflict have been long-lasting.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: The conflict has affected everyday life throughout the country.</div>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: Research shows that the presence of living plants impact both cognition and affect.
                    </div>
                </blockquote> “Effect” can also be a verb, in which case it means to bring about: <blockquote>
                    <div>CORRECT: The conflict effected major international policy changes.</div>
                </blockquote> That sentence is saying that the conflict <em>brought about</em> policy changes. If you
                wanted
                to say that the conflict influenced (but did not itself cause) policy changes, you would write that the
                conflict affected policy changes. <h1>The dilemma of gendered language in English</h1> What to do about
                gender with an unspecified subject? In the past, the consensus was to always use “he” and readers were
                supposed to understand that the subject might be female. As you know, <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/gender-inclusive-language/">that’s no longer
                    accepted</a>.
                The culture of formal academic writing hasn’t settled on a widely supported solution yet, which creates
                a
                pervasive problem for the student writer. Informally, using “they/their” as the neutral singular is
                becoming
                a common practice. For example, if a Facebook friend hasn’t specified a gender, Facebook used to exhort
                you
                to “write on their timeline” for “their birthday.” I hear this more and more in spoken language as well.
                For
                example, most people who hear this sentence spoken wouldn’t note a glaring problem: “A doctor who makes
                a
                mistake is often too scared to admit their slip-up.” However, in an academic paper, that sentence would
                be
                considered a pronoun-antecedent error because “doctor” is singular and “their” is still considered
                plural.
                Most of your professors still don’t accept they/their as a gender-neutral singular possessive. Hopefully
                in
                coming years, academic writing will come to accept this perfectly reasonable solution to the gendered
                language problem, but we’re not there yet. <div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">

                        <p class="Student-Voices">My first semester in college, it was my standard practice to rotate
                            back
                            and forth between the male and female pronouns. I did not want to appear sexist and was
                            unsure
                            how to avoid doing so. Referring to the same hypothetical person in one of my papers I
                            wrote,
                            “When one is confronted by new information that does not fit tidily onto her personal map…”
                            Later in the paragraph I referred to the same individual by saying, “This new information
                            demands that he forsake the world of the Cave in which he had been raised.” Obviously, in
                            retrospect, that was confusing and certainly not the best option. But it illustrates the
                            point
                            that this can be a challenging dilemma. Thankfully for you, three more appropriate solutions
                            are
                            provided in this chapter.</p>
                        <p class="Student-Voices">Peter Farrell</p>
                    </div>
                </div> So what to do? Here are three possible solutions. <ol>
                    <li><em>Choose plurals when possible</em>. For example, “Doctors who make mistakes are often too
                        scared
                        to admit their slip-ups.”</li>
                    <li><em>Write “he or she” or “his or her” if it’s not too repetitive</em>. You don’t want to have
                        more
                        than two or three such “ors” in a paragraph, but a couple wouldn’t be tedious for the reader.
                        For
                        example, one might write, “A doctor who makes a mistake is often too scared to admit his or her
                        slip-up. He or she might be forbidden from doing so by hospital attorneys.”</li>
                    <li><em>Consider whether a real-life example is better than a hypothetical subject</em>. Long
                        passages
                        about hypothetical people and situations often lack argumentative force. If you’re writing a
                        paper
                        about medical errors, you might do better to replace hypothetical claims like the above example
                        with
                        real-life examples of physicians who have made mistakes but were reluctant or forbidden to
                        acknowledge them. Better yet, discuss the results of studies of medical errors and their
                        outcomes.
                        In addition to solving the gendered language problem, real examples are more persuasive.</li>
                </ol> Remember, it’s about precision and respect. Whatever you do, don’t just write “he” for doctors,
                attorneys, and construction workers and “she” for nurses, social workers, and flight attendants. You
                also
                shouldn’t just write “he” or “his” for everything, expecting your readers to mentally fill in the “or
                she”
                and “or her” themselves. <a target="_blank"

                    so seems lazy, if not actively sexist</a>. Showing respect through precise language about gender
                makes
                you seem much more credible. <h1>Conclusion</h1> This chapter does not (and could not) provide a
                complete
                run-down of formal English language usage. You would do well to bookmark a couple good reference sources
                to
                consult when questions arise. If your writing usually has a lot of errors in it, don’t despair. Identify
                one
                or two practices to master and then learn them, using the feedback from your instructors as a guide. You
                can’t become a flawless writer overnight (and no one writes flawlessly all the time). But over the
                course of
                a few semesters, you can certainly produce more precise text that presents your ideas in their best
                light.
