# Writing In College

I've adapted *Writing In College: From Competence to Excellence* to be a single HTML page. A seperated version can be found on [the publishers website](https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/writing-in-college-from-competence-to-excellence/). I did not care for the seperated version and they only provided an option to download the book as `XML`, so I've seperated the books contents from the `XML` file and am hosting the page on: [github pages](https://wchesley.github.io/Writing-In-College/)
